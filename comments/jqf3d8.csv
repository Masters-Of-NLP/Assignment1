jqf3d8,"This article appeared in one of the newspapers a couple of years ago. If I'm not wrong, this picture is of a young African man who paid a hefty amount to human traffickers to get to Napoli, Italy, but the traffickers landed him in Nepal. This picture was taken from his room in Kirtipur according to the article.     
He had spent all his savings and even borrowed money from his friends and relatives for the trip. He cannot escape out of Nepal because his family and friends think he reached Europe and are asking their money back while he is in Kathmandu and unable to stand the cruel reality. He does daily wages to earn bread and butter here. He is in a dilemma of asking for more money and then traveling to Europe or confronting the truth and then returning to his home.",7,09-11-2020 03:17,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

jqf3d8,"Deep down I hate this city. I dunno why this sub is obsessed with KTM. One of the worst places in the country in terms of pollution, probably the worst. Doesn‚Äôt help when it‚Äôs inhabited by millions. The inequality is rife and the people fortunate to repose in the upper side of the spectrum carry a disgusting smug. Let‚Äôs not even get into the prevalent drug culture. Also, the forced English slangs in their accents just irks me the wrong way. I guess it‚Äôs a nice place for an extrovert, but I can‚Äôt wait to get out of the convoluted mess.

I guess this dialogue from the movie Loot actually explains Kathmandu in every aspect 
A beautiful city, a city of dreams, the people and their chaotic behavior, the extravagant nature, the hunger of getting more money, the self-centered life people are living but beneath everything these things also give the peace to a man who returns home so he could sleep thinking at least he earned some money for his family today.
