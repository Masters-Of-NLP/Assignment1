xxaypq,"cheers bud.. i totally get what you are implying, but calling motherhood hideous is just not the right approach. You are entitled to your opinion but i believe motherhood to be beautiful. The gift of life, probably the greatest gift one can give. Even so, what i believe is parents must understand parenthood to the core. Like you said, they are forcefully bringing somebody into existence, hence they must be able to provide. The baby must be given utmost care, love and respect and nothing must be expected from it. This mindset of Nepalese society to expect their children to be rich powerful and support them throughout their life is pretty fucked up.

Will it end the suffering? Will it remove all the pain? Will it remove all the diseases? Will it save them from old age? Will it save them from death?
