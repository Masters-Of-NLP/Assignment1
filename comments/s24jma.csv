s24jma,">Mongol-ized

Just as actual social justice warriors in Murica have provided white nationalists and alt-right with ammo for ""white man in danger"" narrative, the creation of Mongol National Organization and its consequences have been a disaster to Adivasi Janajati issues in Nepal.

I am 1000% sure Kumaonis and Garwhalis now and Thakuri nobles back then hated the Gorkhali monarchy than anyone else. It's not a ""Mongol"" issue. People are bound to hate a monarchy that does not represent them and historically took away their lands and rights, specifically when Prithvi Narayan Shah is the symbol of ""Hindu rashtra"" and ""Asali Hindustan"" for so many Hindu nationalists.

This is similar to asking Siberian Turks like Yakuts and Chechens in Russia why they don't celebrate Cossack heroes or Russian Tsars who expanded Russia. Or asking Native Americans why they want Columbus Day gone. While our example here in Nepal is not to that extreme, it is almost laughable to pretend atrocities did not happen while Gorkha was expanding. Of course, this happened in a time period where everyone else expanded that way so I personally see no point in hating a dead man.

I want Nepal to be celebrated as a nation, a modern secular nation that represents all of her people and I am sure many people here agree with this statement. Me personally, I hate Prithvi Narayan Shah because he is the epitome of ""Great Man theory"" in action in the context of Nepal.

s24jma,"Yes, you may be correct there is a lot of theoretical in this situation since it's hypothetical anyways.

Nepal is too close to the heartland to be marginalized like the northeastern states. A large part of the rift between the northeast states is also how culturally different they are from the whole idea of India/South Asia.

* Nepal is much closer to other Indian states in terms of culture and language. Nepal has a huge population for being in the Himalayas.
* Nepal would be already ""unified"" into today's territory by the time India gained independence.
* I don't think Nepal would be broken up since that would give 3 States the official language of Nepali so I think they would try to unite the Nepali speaking hills.
* Terai is a different story and I think if early on the majority of Madhesi districts are split and given to Bihar and UP then it will be for the better. I think eastern terai past Kosi, Chitwan, Northern Lumbini terai and far western Terai will stay with Nepal as it has higher Pahadi or Pahadi and Tharu population.
* There definitely will be more development in terms of infrastructure and employment, Highways stretch across Himanchal and Uttarkhandi hills and even trains go up to Shimla. Statewide education programs and healthcare will also have a bigger backing of the central government.
* Kathmandu will be the center obviously and will see much growth as being a State capital and the largest urban region in the Himalayas.
* Nepali politics will be the state politics and will join the handful of states who have communist parties, like West Bengal, Kerela, Tripura but I think it will be a lot weaker in Nepal since the Nepali congress will have a stronger support system  while the communist party will be targeted and sidelined.
* Nepali communities will have a greater presence in Metros like Dehli's and Mumbai and there might be some settlers in the Kathmandu urban region of people from throughout India.

Which Honestly could have been prevented if it was made its own state or a union territory like Dehli or Chandigarh.

Nepal doesn't have that kind of place, or sentiment unless the Newars of Kathmandu valley disliking other Nepali becomes a strong enough problem that a shiv sena like coalition forms, which even if it happens will not be a strong coalition since it won't even be supported by all the newars.

Ethnic tensions are bound to occur when you have a multi-ethnic/cultural nation but Nepal has been relatively calm in this aspect compared to other regions of the world that are as diverse as Nepal. I also think it is because since Nepali took over as the dominant language and most of Nepal is also united by religion, Hindu/Buddhist and even Kirat and other Shaman religions are extensions of the Dharmic fold.

""It would always be claiming Darjeeling, the whole sikkim, gigantic chunks of Uttarkhand, and some from UP and Bihar.""

* I don't think this would be much of a problem since Sikkim joined India decades after independence and in this timeline, they would just join India via an extension of Nepal.
* Uttarkhand was formed in 2000 out of Uttar Pradesh as the residents of the Hills wanted a separate state as they didn't culturally, linguistically feel represented and neglected by such a large state government. When they created Uttarkhand they added Terai districts with high population density so the new state is almost 50% Hindi/Urdu defeating the whole reasoning of a separate hill state. Uttarkhand is made up of two cultural spheres of Kumaon and Garhwal, both are a sister culture/language/ethnicity of the Khas, who dominate Nepal culturally. So instead of being trapped in a Hindi-speaking state, I believe there wouldn't be much resistance for it to join Nepal. This is not uncommon as the state of Kerela was formed by merging the linguistically similar Malabar region and the neighboring Kingdoms of Travancore. But also if Uttarkhand doesn't want to join Nepal then I don't think there is enough sentiment in Nepal for any extremism about this.

""We would be an anti-Hindi state.""

* This would make sense since we don't speak Hindi natively, Government, Education will all be conducted in Nepali but since Hindi is close to Nepali Hindi speakers will be fine to travel or work. It will be other north Indian states with a non-Hindi denomination, like Gujrat, Punjab, West Bengal, Assam which are not Hindi-speaking states but Hindi friendly, not like Tamil-nadu or Kerela which are ""anti-Hindi"" and understandably so given the context.",0,13-01-2022 21:19,False,neutral,,negative,neutral

s24jma,"Ok, let's say I agree, Nepali speakers in Gorakhland are having a tough time getting a state.  But logically if you use your brain you don't think Nepali will exist in a separate Nepali state in India? Language and culture can't be erased so easily, there are 29 states in India and all are separate from one another and retain cultural and linguistic identity. Are you bringing up Gorakhland to tell me how Nepal will be treated in India?  

How does this connect to my comment about how for marginalized groups in Nepal it would not matter which government is marginalizing them. Do you understand what marginalized is? In Nepal are you living in a fairytale land where you don't see these societal problems? I don't know where to begin with this singular mindset.
