mcx754,"You are judging Mahendra's policies through the specs of 21st century. You need to look at the context and background that gave rise to such policies. The concept of Nepal and Nepaliness didn't exist at the time. Nepal referred to Kathmandu only. People identified more with their caste, community and territorial identity. The concept of Nepal as a country and being a Nepali citizen was as non existent as it can get on the minds of Nepali people. Delhi, Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Banaras were closer to the hearts and lives of Nepali citizens than Kathmandu. Go ask your elders who lived through the time.

A Madhesi from Janakarpur or Birgunj identified more with Bhojpuri and Maithili speakers of UP and Bihar. Khas in Western Nepal shared the same feeling for Gadhwal, Kumaoni and other Indian Pahadi Khas. Same with Tibeto-Burmese groups. There must be some element that connects a Madhesi with Sherpa, a Tharu from Bardiya to a Limbu in Bhojpur. 

Geopolitically, Asians countries especially China, South East Asia and South Asia were on metamorphosis phase. Countries were forming and devolving every other day. So, it was necessary to install the idea of oneness among the culturally, linguistically divided citizens of this nation.

And this is not unique to Nepal only. This sort of policies and ideas are adopted and implemented by every other country in the world to unite the citizens of the country under a common banner.

Even today, what's the thing that connects the 125 ethnic groups with each other in Nepal? Nothing but the shared idea of Nepaliness put forward by Mahendra. Take the concept out, the country with disintegrate in no time. That's what happened with Yugoslavia because people identified more with their tribal identity than the idea of being an Yugoslavian.

mcx754,"R u joking? Mahendra's explicit agenda of pushing what it means to be Nepali and ""Nepali-ness"" did uncharted harm. So much so that in the next few generations I suspect linguistic diversity of this country to plummet and many languages to be functionally extinct. In my opinion, we would have been a much more stable country if that ethno-linguistic-nationalist phase of idiots who ran the country was avoided.



>It's globalization or more balantly westernization. All cultural things that have been replaced are being replaced by western things.

Change is imminent. But the outcomes of change will be determined by the present. Our desire to self-colonize comes from the mistakes of past generations. Such as the conflating intelligence with fluency in english stems from the rana regime making english education exclusive for their own kin and thus getting high ranking jobs. They didn't see the rana's nepotism but reasoned that it was the english foreign education that made them eligible. Something that continues to this day, as evident by the abundance of fake accents that people magically aquire.

mcx754,"What you just said is the literal meaning of propaganda. Even if there were ""pros"" to mahendra's policies they are invisible now or were temporary. We as a nation are still fragile. If 50 years of the same propaganda hasn't done much it is so because it is unnaturally pushed. 

You take the wrong lesson from the fall of yugoslavia. It didn't fall because there were disparate identities, it fell because a single identity was taking over and forcing their identity upon others. Now all of the nations that previously made YGS are peaceful and prosperous. We could have been too. The idea of a nation needs to be natural. When it is forced it is bound to alienate which is why mahendra's policies didn't work, which is why we are still unstable.

Mahendra's vision was Nepali-ness but it translated as khas ethno nationalism. That needs to be understood because it is the basis of many of our problems that we align his head of Nepali-ness instead of redefining it and actually justifing it",2,25-03-2021 19:53,False,negative,neutral,negative,negative

mcx754,">I never gave any argument supporting mahendra so your replay is unwarranted. I also know mahendra's yek bhasa yek bhes mission. And i don't support it. 

I never said you supported it. I said you were conflating the effects of mahendra's nationalistic policies with the effects of globalization. Which is absolutely warranted because how does one come to that conclusion?

>Globalisation in itself is not something harmful but you need to realise that globalization is direct consequence of colonialism and imperialism which endorsed ""white supremacy"" and still continues to do so.

I won't discuss this here. This will run in tangents which is beside the point I was trying to make. One thing tho, globalization was imminent. Colonisation and imperialism were not. Regarding the rest, one needs to respect ones own culture to fight foreign influence.

>Heck, not just the linguistic diversity but dominant language itself is in danger. So, without fighting this global cultural erasure how do you ensure regional cultural diversity? 

I suggest you read the pedagogy of the oppressed. 

Also, what you don't understand is the importance of communities. Small communities when the state is not trying to erase their existence is much more effective at maintaining their language and culture rather than a huge national community. This is why we fail. When people forget their heritage everything is transactional, to a magar or tharu person what is forgetting nepali when they have no idea how their mother tongue is like? That individual would rather learn english and be employed somewhere else. But if a person is more connected to something that is their own and a community that is thriving than it is different. This is where globalisation becomes glocal. Where local tastes and preferences are respected. 

>Also, Nepali language didn't became lingua franca of Nepal because of Gorkhali conquest. It was used as such long before them. Even court of malla used khas kura to communicate with other magar kingdoms.

Firstly, source? Second, diplomatic exchanges doesn't make a language lingua franca. Nepali language wasn't made lingua france until mahendra's forced policies. It isn't even the lingua franca in nepal today, many nepali people don't speak it and some regions the speakers of nepali are extremely limited.",0,25-03-2021 17:57,False,neutral,,negative,neutral
mcx754,"Since, you are bringing up different minorities as being marginalized by the policy, let me remind you that the ""Nepali identity"" marginalized Khas identity as well. The Daura Suruwal, Topi, Nepali language is as foreign to a Khas. The Nepali identity was a mixture of some widely accepted and some dominant aspects prevalent in the region. Daura Suruwal and Topi itself comes from Newar community. Those aren't Khas outfits.

Nepali language was widely spoken and understood hence it became the Lingua francua. But then again, the Nepali language we speak isn't exactly Khas language either. It's the very much standardized and modernized form of the Khas language. Go to Western Nepal, you won't understand a lick of what they are saying.

They speak totally different dialect which borders the line of being classified as separate language. Their language share more in common with Kumaoni and Gadhwali language than standardized language.

Though, I believe that the government should have made plans to promote and preserve other local languages.

This is so weird. You are really portraying mahendra's policies as inclusive? We were fine before his policies let me remind you that.
