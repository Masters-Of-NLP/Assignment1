mrhwnu,"Someday soon in a universe near you, you will see foreigners coming to Nepal to get their degrees. It's incredibly cheap for Americans and the textbooks and exams are all in English. The exams are almost entirely essay and some of the examiners don't speak English very well, so the more words the better the grade. 

Nepal is also an excellent place to do an internship or thesis for a graduate or doctorate degree. Of course you wouldn't want to come here for a physics degree, but social work, environmental and healthcare types of degrees would be wonderful to do here. 

I recently went to the Ayrveda hospital in Kirtipur and the doctor said they are planning to open up classes for international students. That's part of the internationally accredited university, so it would be an amazing opportunity for young people. Students will bring a lot of good to Nepal. I'm already encouraging people to explore Nepal as an educational bargain. Here's a video we did where I talk about this subject.
