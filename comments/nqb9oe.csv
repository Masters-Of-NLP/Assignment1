nqb9oe,"They are technically correct, but it’s a pretty common speech pattern that many native English speakers will do as well. You may come across both ways of saying the same thing in normal, colloquial speech. Formal writing and speech would follow the rule more strictly, but even then you might come across the same “mistake” from time to time. Most people don’t think about that rule at all, either when speaking or listening.

Interestingly, you pretty much never hear the opposite mistake from native speakers. For example: “fewer water”, “fewer heat”, etc. You would always hear “less water” or “less heat”.",2,02-06-2021 16:52,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
