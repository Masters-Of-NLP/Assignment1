Imagine low food consumption as per your needs shows two things. First, respect to the food that comes to your plate. Second, lowering the demand and so does the lowered price of the food so all can afford by a little bit.

[https://www.worldvision.org/hunger-news-stories/5-worst-spots-hunger](https://www.worldvision.org/hunger-news-stories/5-worst-spots-hunger)

We're not that better than Africa. People have this idea that hunger is something that exists largely in Africa, which while true to some extent is not actually factual in the sense people think.

The hunger in Africa is largely due to [manufactured famines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvSW5Ez0koM) and state sponsored starvation in various Sub-Saharan States. While, Asia just has downright hunger due to lack of cheap foods. Logistics and Price is the primary reason for hunger, which is what we can actually change using non-political means hence the focus of world hunger should be Asia, not Africa in my opinion.",1,08-10-2021 18:04,False,negative,,negative,negative

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

bad use of units le bad result ta lyaucha ni. Anyways aviation has been using imperial mostly world wide for more than a century and there's been no issues that could be fixed by switching to SI. In situations where we Nepali dont use SI using it wouldnt bring any benefits either.

>Changing units takes lot of costs that's why US uses mixed system till today. But many people hates them anyway.

US uses metric where it's needed like science fields and imperial where it's not. Seems pretty satisfactory to me and the only one hating it seem to be non Americans who can't stand that other countries have different things. As stupid to me as getting mad when someone speaks in German online instead of English even tho English is lingua franca of the world,

Anyways I'm not talking about officially using SI or not. Just in daily use like how we use feet and inches for height of person or even temperature of a person during fever that you said we should move away from. Using SI in these situations bring no advantage, in terms of things like body temperature it brings more disadvantages even.

>Its not just a fad that everyone keeps recommending you to use standards.
