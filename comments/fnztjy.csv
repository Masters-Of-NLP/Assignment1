fnztjy,"That's literally not how languages work. It's not like a few random people pronouncing it differently. It's entire regions for many many years.

fnztjy,"Yes, this is how new languages are formed in first place. But I'm damn sure for most part majority of Indian and even Pakistani pronounce it as daal and not dhal.",0,24-03-2020 15:36,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
fnztjy,"Pretty common in Lahore and Karachi to say dhal. Also pretty common in my local Desi grocery to say dhal. So common, in fact, that I've always romanized it as dhal my whole life.

My point is, it's a valid name and romanization. THOUGH if the Nepal(ese?) word for condom is dhal and the store owners knew that, then that's a little odd. Maybe they were just playing a joke/pun on the tourists",2,24-03-2020 15:37,False,neutral,neutral,positive,neutral
fnztjy,I think the problem with our discussion is that we are thinking of two different pronunciation of dhal. If you know devnagari then I'm thinking dhal as ढाल and दाँल. Whereas daal दाल is correct pronunciation.,1,24-03-2020 15:40,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
fnztjy,"I can't read that script. I can read Urdu and dhal is spelt دال where the first letter on the right is the 'd' sound.

fnztjy,"Then, ढा and दाँ sounds pretty similar too. So, the ढा in dhal of urdu might be mispronounciation of devnagari दाँ. I'm not expert but it might happen that urdu don't have  दाँ sound altogether. So, urdu speaker might have taken the closest possible sound to दाँ which is ढा.",1,24-03-2020 15:48,False,neutral,neutral,positive,neutral
fnztjy,"Perhaps. 

I'm guessing this is one of those cases where Urdu and Hindi differ in their pronunciation of certain words. They are different languages but so orally similar it's easy to forget that. Though I have certainly also heard Pakistani folk pronounce it with the hard D, which I'm guessing is retained from their pre-partition localizations. Certainly not all Pakistani speak Urdu though it is the national language. Many speak Punjabi and Hindi and pushto etc as well. So even more variations of the word will exist.

Also I would use the word derivative over mispronunciation. These other names are derived from the original name and adopted into new languages. Mispronunciation makes more sense if the speaker was claiming to still speak the same language. Though in that case, if there's enough differences, that's then called a dialect. And it also becomes a valid pronounciation.

So basically, with how languages work, it's only a mispronunciation (as in invalid pronounciation) if not enough people say it lol",1,24-03-2020 15:51,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
fnztjy,"Actually, the word dal/daal is sanskrit word. That's why I said it is correct word because all other language in subcontinent retained it from sanskrit. In sanskrit, dhal means shield. Sanskrit was written in brahmi and later in devnagari which is phonetic script. So, they write both differently and we can see the differences clearly. 

Hindi and urdu are both descendants of hindustani which have huge influence from farsi and arabic. Actually it's India's attempt of sanskritization of hindustani that gave rise to hindi. While urdu kept it's farsi and arabic roots more intact. For ex: sukriya in urdu is farsi but dhanyabad in hindi is directly from sanskrit. Also, strict pronunciation rules were for brahmins so they won't pass down wrong sutras and mantras because of our historic oral traditions. But generally people would mispronounce words here and there. I see it everyday with nepali speakers. And i cringe every time.",1,24-03-2020 15:59,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
fnztjy,"Okay. Replace everything I said about derived from Hindi with Sanskrit (I thought Sanskrit was the script. TIL). Everything else still holds true.

It's not a mispronunciation if enough people say it. The derivatives become either a new language or dialect.

Also there's a third word for thank you in Urdu which is Jazak Allah (thank God) which is Arabic. That's the one I use lol. Urdu is a fun language. I once was at lunch and noticed the three friends sitting in front of me were Persian, Arab, and Hindi (who I now know knew some Sanskrit too).

fnztjy,">It's not a mispronunciation if enough people say it. The derivatives become either a new language or dialect.

Of course, if you look at it from the linguistic point of view from those languages which ""mispronounce"" certain words from another language.

But my view is coming from me being nepali speaker who call it daal and not dhal. We are certainly mispronouncing it. Also, dhal have completely different meanings already in our language.",1,24-03-2020 16:07,False,negative,negative,negative,negative
