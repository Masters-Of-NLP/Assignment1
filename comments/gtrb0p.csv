African Americans have more populations in the Southern States where still the Whites tend to have a majority by a large margin. You would be surprised there are only 12% African Americans in the United States.  
Even in the cities where Blacks are majority like Detroit or New Orleans, its the white who will discriminate against Blacks with the power of the state.

In Madhesi majority cities like Janakpur, Rajbiraj, the Madhesi can easily oppress Khas minority. Unlike what you hear in the politically correct medias, the Madhesh is commanded by  regional zamindars who is usually a Kayastha or Madhesi Brahmin, on whose fields the Khas, Madhesi low-caste people work. During the Rana Regime, these zamindars would further pay taxes to the Rana bada-hakim.

This was the whole reason why Congress was successful in Madhesh. When King Mahendra came up with BhumiSudhar ain, which would restrict the zamindars to own only a certain amount of land, these zamindars went against it so supported the Congress. The zamindars could command all the people within his territory to support a certain candidate. Since communist also had the same agenda of Bhumi-Sudhar, they could never get a hold in the Madhesh.  


A closer comparison would be that of a Dalit. If in a village, there are 100 dailit family and 1 thakuri family, the more certain thing would be that the thakuri family would be oppressing the 100 dalit family.

Sure, not all may understand Hindi but it is a link language that at least the current generation understands, and something that many older folks will respond to as well. Many newer generation have also started speaking Nepali fluently, even in the remote villages, so even Nepali is taking up the spot as a link language and even replacing Hindi as the lingua franca. And in all this, I am not talking about a Hindi that is the standardised Hindi spoken in India's news channels, it is much more colloquial and contextual.
