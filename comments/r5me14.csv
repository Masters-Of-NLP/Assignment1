r5me14,"To some extent, i also used to feel the same then I started experiencing shit in government offices, government banks and other governing bodies to realize, no this shit will never end in Nepal. I have seen people of our generation taking bribes for doing stuff, people of my age being corrupt. So to simply put it this way I was shell shocked, I used to believe our generation would stay far away from this shit but more the things I started experiencing away from my comfort the more I realize, our generation is going to be even more corrupt. Just look at the lifestyle some of the kids and people of our generation are living, we are getting more and more lavish, hami saano huda bihe ma bahek aru kei ma party, bhoj hunxa vanera ni tahathiyena, look at now. People are throwing party for even tiniest of thing. Will for more money = either hardwork or easy money.

r5me14,"I've been to both and mountains are by far my favourite between the two. Just my opinion though.

I wouldn't go so far as to nuke the mountains to make roads even though I know how difficult it is to develop physical infrastructure in the mountains. As far as the snow-capped ones concerned, I believe there shouldn't be a highway running through them. 

Rapid urbanization, unplanned wanton construction isn't the way to go either. There should be some wisdom in planning and development.
Some places are better left to the nature, with humans assuming the role of a visitor.",8,30-11-2021 14:32,False,neutral,neutral,positive,neutral
r5me14,"I beg to differ, Nepal is extremely under-rated country. Countries like Thailand, Dubai, Maldives, etc. are over-rated ( Just some hints of Nature, overshadowed by development and infrastructures. ) This might not come as a surprise, but not many people give shit about where the tallest mountain is, or where buddha was born. Hence, not many foreigners are aware about Nepal. With a bit of developments and infrastructures, Nepal has much more to showcase..(including of-course from Sagarmatha and Lumbini )",7,30-11-2021 14:47,False,neutral,neutral,positive,neutral
