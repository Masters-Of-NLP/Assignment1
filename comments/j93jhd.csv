j93jhd,"Ok, so you guys really think that the British signed a treaty that meant that the boundry extended hundreds of kilometers into their territory, rather than the most logical and straight one.

You guys are hell bent on claiming land that is in possession of India for more than hundred years but bury your head in the sand like an ostrich when China fires tear gas shells on your people for surveying your own pillars. Looks like Nepalis are happy to go back to being a tributary state as they once were during Qing dynasty.",-25,11-10-2020 18:08,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

j93jhd,"Oye sanghi chaap cowbelter.
British signed whatever and left which has given you an opportunity to even have a country. Or else you freaking selfish and greedy mofos would have been overpowered by multiple countries. 
Don't cry now when the chinese are doing the same to you.
Or send some sanghis to beg to the british again.
After all you were the ones who were loyal servants of the goras.
If only some of you would know how to respect others territories probably you wouldn't have to be the fools who have been ordered around by almost every crusader.

j93jhd,"abe communist asslicker, look who is talking about being servants. half of your country still salutes their masters around the world.

Hahahahaha
Its not a rape capital like your alleys. And ass licking must be the favorite sanghi pastime. All sanghis have some special affinity for ass.
