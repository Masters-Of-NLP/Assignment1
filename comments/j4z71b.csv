j4z71b,"**Namaste Nepal!**

My name is Meigo Märk and I wish to share with you my [**PHOTOS**](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOp7jaB7QO5HkE-JD0RxcmtXThwoVtAiG8VuA2YDFUSFDZpiMUsU5eo4xHTdNbstw?key=VE5FSHRkclpLQVhVbWZpcHhsUmJyYk4wSi03YWZR) and a [**VIDEO**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx5z6KtovvU&list=PLkuLFY8TBG06h-ZPuwQ2GpSFRI-HbWWOA&index=17) of how I walked across South Nepal over 1,025 kilometres in 80 days.  
**100% walking!** No bus, no train, no car, no motorbike, no bicycle!

This happened already 5 years ago from November 23, 2015 - February 10, 2016

Walking across Nepal was part of a much longer walk in which I walked a total of 20,000 kilometres in 22 countries in 4 years and 3 months!

PLEASE LOOK THE DETAIL ROUTE ON THE [**MAP**](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1kZST5-_lEISjBx_rAWfX5DkxQKk)

I have a big dream to walk in different countries at least the distance of planet Earth's Equator which is 40,075 kilometres!

Thank you very very much for your attention!  
I wish you lots of good energies!!  
Please be healthy and positive!!!

j4z71b,"Hello [ihatethisclass101](https://www.reddit.com/user/ihatethisclass101/)! Thanks a lot!   
1. In Nepal I did not really have any difficult parts. Except some areas with some tigers where I walked and camped. There were no big mountains on my way while walking across South Nepal and the weather was fine. People were very friendly and very hospitable and helped me a lot! So walking across all South Nepal was like one smooth 80 day sailing.   
In other countries I had some challendes like walking and camping in the snowy mountains of Turkey with -17 degrees Celsius. Walking across some deserts areas in Iran and in Rajasthan, India with the dialy temperature over +40 degrees Celsius but I kept on walking. Sometimes the rainy periods in different countries have been annoying when for many months all my stuff is wet or very humid. Some more higher crime rate areas in 2 different countries I had heavily armed police escorts walking with me and 2 times I was attacked by dogs. Once in Laos I crossed a big mountain jungle alone and on the third day I finished all the food in my backpack so started to eat raw bamboo leaves.   
But the perhaps the greatest challenges are the inner ones - how to overcome inner negative emotions like greed, anger, hatred and pride and to overcome them with compassion, gratitude and peace.  


2. I would difinetly would like to eat right now some vegan momos with a vegan chow mein and a big bowl of homemade dal soup.   


3.  In Nepal I never had this feeling of ""Man, this was a bad idea, what was I thinking!""   
Had it strongly in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. ""Ouuu sh\*t! What have I done? I wish I did not do it!""  But they turned out to be really great learning, growing and becoming wiser experiences.",2,05-10-2020 03:02,True,neutral,,positive,neutral
j4z71b,"Hello [BountyHunter19XX](https://www.reddit.com/user/BountyHunter19XX/)!   
Thanks for writing!  
How are you?   
Great questions!   


To walk 20,000 kilometers in 22 countries in a total of 4 years and 3 months.   
I had many resting days and resting periods so I managed to keep my health and weight balanced. My weight varied only 6-7 kilograms from minimum to maximum.   
For over 13 years I have been a very strict vegetarian not eating any meat, fish, or eggs. And the last over 4 years a vegan not even eating any milk products.   
I managed to keep it that way 100% even while traveling.   
While on the road I ate a lot of peanuts and fruits. Always had some peanuts in my bag.  
Personally, I feel that a vegan diet has helped me A LOT but I know it will not suit everyone.   


Thanks a lot, [BountyHunter19XX](https://www.reddit.com/user/BountyHunter19XX/)!   
I really loved the hospitality of the Nepali people and the beautiful nature of Nepal!   
I will surely return to explore much more of Nepal in the future!

Thanks a lot for writing!   
How and where are you?

Because my walking route was very narrow I missed many landmarks.   
The biggest ones that I visited were Lumbini and Kapilavastu.   
I dream and plan to return to Nepal to explore more after I finish the long tour around the world.   
The most special experiences for me have not been visiting the landmarks but to stay in a local home together with a local family! Home is the most private place - a holy place. To see and to feel everything from the inside is one of the most special and enriching experiences that can happen to any traveler.

j4z71b,"Hello [sesme77](https://www.reddit.com/user/sesme77/)!   
While walking a total of 20,000 kilometers in 22 countries in over 4 years, the weight of my bag varied a lot. Depending on the weather and climate from 8 - 23 kilograms.

All my stuff changed many times even my passport became totally full.

So what was usually inside my bag?

I always carried a tent, sleeping bag, small mattress, hat, few t-shirts usually 3-5, 2 pairs of short trousers, 1 pair of long trousers, underwear, socks, washing stuff like toothbrush, paste, soap, a small very strong plastic covers for washing things, small tower, toilet paper or tissue paper, nail cutter, sometimes shaving stuff sometimes not. Some bandages to cover wounds, some oils and creams to heal bug bites and muscle pains, a needle and a thread to fix stuff, some tape, some small ropes, mosquito spray if they were around.

What else?

Very well packed passport, bank card, ID card, money, the flag of Estonia, a notebook and pencil, mobile, small pocket camera, small mp3 player with a very good battery, earphones, charges for the mobile and camera, later I had a very good solar charger that was on my bag in the daytime.

A very big world map not for navigation but to show my route and the location of my home country, some very small lucky gifts that people gave me, usually a book or even 2, later I had a kindle reader which was a gift for me and also 2 water filters with bottles.

When I started I had a small laptop but later I managed to do everything with mobile and I was given a small external Bluetooth keyboard for faster typing.

A lighter, a knife to cut tomatoes and stuff, sometimes small foldable scissors, a foldable silicone bowl, and a cup, fork, and a spoon.

When I was colder or raining I had a jacket, raincoat, or even thermal clothes and thermal socks. I have gifted a bamboo flute which I carried and learned to play.

Cannot remember more things now.

I used became very fond of some pair of sandals and felt them very comfortable.   
I never walked with sandals and socks. Sometimes when I stayed in someplace I just used to mix them in the mornings and evenings when the weather was a bit cooler.",1,05-10-2020 11:11,True,neutral,,positive,neutral

j4z71b,"Hello, [ilikerawmeat](https://www.reddit.com/user/ilikerawmeat/)!   
Thanks a lot for writing! How are you?  
By profession, I am a musician. I studied classical European music, how to play the trumpet, piano, and how to compose music.  


In my long walk of 20,000 kilometers in 22 countries in over 4 years, all my travel expenses for 1 FULL YEAR (foods, drinks, accommodations, some new shoes, clothes, travel and hiking equipment, few new mobile phones and cameras that broke on the way, all the visas and tickets for popular touristic places, and all the other stuff) were average 3,000 - 3,600 euros which are 400,000 - 500,000 Nepali rupees for 1 full year.   


Before I started this long walk I had my own house in Estonia in Northern Europe. I rented out my house and the monthly rent money started to help a bit. But on the starting day, the amount of money that I had in my pocket and my bank account was a total of 8 euros which is less than 1,100 Nepali rupees. I filled up my water bottles in the petrol stations, found some public water pumps, and asked for water from my fellow countrymen like a beggar. Bought some very cheap bread and I was even collecting, washing, and eating many big bags of edible leaves from the roadside.   
Those were the very first weeks before I received the first rent money.   
After 1 year of traveling, I sold my house!  
For over 650 nights I slept alone in a tent and I also slept in over 220 local homes together with the local families who invited me to their homes. Almost every day I was helped by many local people in different villages who were very surprised to see me, asked many questions, were inspired by the long walk, and offered me free drinks, food, new shoes, and many other gifts. So many kind and helpful people in the world! Especially smaller places where tourists normally never go. I was helped by over 2,200 kind people on the way and many people around the world were also inspired and really wanted to send me donations.   


I was also asked to write some travel and [**news articles**](https://www.google.com/search?q=meigo+m%C3%A4rk&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjt6OfC5uToAhUfzIsBHUMrAxgQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=meigo+m%C3%A4rk&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECCMQJzIECCMQJzoGCAAQCBAeOgcIIxDqAhAnOgIIADoECAAQQzoECAAQHjoGCAAQBRAeOgQIABAYUCpYkyVguidoCnAAeAOAAZIBiAHuF5IBBTE2LjE0mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWewAQo&sclient=img&ei=LgqUXu2ZFp-Yr7wPw9aMwAE&bih=610&biw=1280&safe=active), gave some [**international interviews,**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_5a3_trHA&list=PLkuLFY8TBG07n5dLv4A4kmAExFrgDcj6_) and earned a bit of money with my [**travel photos**](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPG0YwSa8wtNJ21dQhB5Z2jVnvYJBZDHIuy9yl4xaAllGFsoaap2I7En4dwXIxSdg?key=S1pBSUkyc29JRmw2ekZGaXh4cF8xS1R4UEU0TklR) and [**YouTube videos**](https://www.youtube.com/meigomark)",1,05-10-2020 11:01,True,neutral,,negative,neutral

2. Before this walking tour, I had already visited Nepal in 2012. That time I was mostly exploring North areas near the Himalayas. Did some trekking but also used cars, buses, etc...  
Totally fell in love with the Nepali people and nature and really wanted to return.  

3. I did not consult any Nepalese while planning my route and travel plans.   
I just searched for some information on the internet.  

4. I was invited to visit some schools, to share some travel experiences, and to answer questions. Never crashed in by myself, only went when invited.   

5. Yes, I will definitely return to Nepal to explore much more!  

6. I don't know exactly how much money I spent in Nepal. But in my long walk of 20,000 kilometers in 22 countries in over 4 years all my travel expenses for 1 FULL YEAR (foods, drinks, accommodations, some new shoes, clothes, travel and hiking equipment, few new mobile phones and cameras that broke on the way, all the visas and tickets for popular touristic places, and all the other stuff) were average 3,000-3,600 euros which are 400,000 - 500,000 Nepali rupees for 1 full year.  

7. In Nepal, the best experiences were inside the local homes. Few people invited me to stay and to sleep in their homes with their families. Those were always very interesting and beautiful experiences. Home is the most private place - a holy place. To be inside and local home together with a local family is surely one of the most special and enriching experiences that can happen to any traveler.   
In Nepal, I did not have any really bad experience. Only once y mobile got stolen but it was largely my own fault. I was invited to visit one small school and left my mobile for charging in one room and left the room. Someone took it. The teachers searched so many places but could not find it. The principal was crying on my knees and told me how sad he is. But his lead to another interesting experience as we went to visit 4 different shamans or witches that did some very interesting rituals to see who took my mobile. Hahaaa...  

8. Walking across  Nepal was a very very beautiful experience. The hospitality of the Nepali people is amazing. So many people invited me to stay in their homes, were very trusting and open. A lot of people helped me on the road by giving me free drinks and food! A huge help!!! I have traveled now in over 40 countries but Nepal and Nepali people are still my absolute nr. 1 favorite and I really dream and plan to return one day!",2,05-10-2020 09:30,True,positive,,positive,positive

j4z71b,"Hello dear [legit-testicals](https://www.reddit.com/user/legit-testicals/)!   
How are you?   
Thanks a lot for writing. Good questions!   


The inspiration and motivation come naturally from the dream itself.   
Traveling around the world mostly by walking is for me a very real, true, big, and powerful dream which I really want to do.   


What does irl mean? In real life? Currently, I stay in Vietnam together with my wife and daughter. We are waiting for the global virus situation to get better so that we could continue to travel around the world all 3 of us.   
I write a lot of travel stories, articles, collect real-life stories, record songs and music,  make travel photographs, and sometimes sell them. Also, make travel films and vlogs for my [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/meigomark) channel.   


To walk 20,000 kilometers in 22 countries I used a total of 24 pairs of very different shoes. Here is a very short [**VIDEO**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODqI4SjBsvg&list=PLkuLFY8TBG06h-ZPuwQ2GpSFRI-HbWWOA&index=5) from all the shoes.
