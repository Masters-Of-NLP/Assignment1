The first link is in the exact maps location of the first place. But the second link is the nearest possible location that I can remember, if you are near the second link's location, you will see ""Bishal Everest Momo"". Yes, the second one is named Bishal everest, the first one is named ""New Everest Momo"".  


I don't know if they belong to the original everest momo chain, but both of them serve great momo. The first one has 4 different types of sauces, ranging from super mild to super hot. But it is almost always crowded and you would have to share a table with random stranger.   


The second one has two sauces, spicy and super hot. It has ample sitting space. But I prefer the first one more as I can't really handle any of the sauces of the second one.",1,10-04-2023 16:51,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
