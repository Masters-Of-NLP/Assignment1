Then it takes about three days walk to get here from Nepal route, or you can also get here from Indian route in a day about few hours ride and walk. However, you would need a special permit to travel from Indian side. 

We need proper road/air connections so that people can reach us. India has proper road connecting all their border villages, and we Nepali face challenge even to maintain goreto batos.",5,06-05-2020 17:27,True,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

* Do people want to move out to cities / foreign countries for economic reasons?
* Anything else that is interesting?

I have so many questions :-) and a strong desire to come visit the place.

I saved the picture you posted yesterday to show it to my friends so that they could accompany me this time. They're going to love your pictures.

It'd be lovely if you could create a post (or a blog) where you go into detail about the routes you have to take to reach there. I'm sure a lot of people would love to know more about the place.

I, for one, would definitely love visiting your place.

gelxqc,"Thanks.. interesting about the special permit. May be because of the sensitive border around the area. Closest I have been there is half way to Darchula from Dhangadi. We couldn't not make it to Darchula cos the twisty roads scared my mom.. Lol. Far west is beautiful and kind of u touched but too remote even for internal tourism.
