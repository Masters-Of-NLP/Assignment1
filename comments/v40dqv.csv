basic concepts were tested but most students ran after questions that most teachers labelled 'important' or were frequently asked in previous years. the ones crying now are the students who skipped most of the theory. The books were old, teaching methodology was old, plus no study leave for maths exams. next batches are going to find maths easier. most questions will not carry more than 4 marks, proving type questions are barely asked. weak students who were expecting to pull out marks from Rolle's theorem, first principle derivative... were the ones who suffered as these questions werent asked at all, or were asked in theoretical form (basic)",8,04-06-2022 03:37,False,negative,neutral,negative,negative
