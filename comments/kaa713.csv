kaa713,"OP meant 3d because he modelled/rendered the whole 3d environment in blender, but obviously this is just a picture which is 2d. So if you can see the perception of depth in the picture, you can say its 3d(not necessarily tho).",3,10-12-2020 09:59,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

kaa713,EEVEE only supports rendering with 1 gpu and it doesn't need a expensive GPU just needs Open GL 3.3 or higher. Also when I first started blender I used a free render farm called SHEEPIT and did all my scenes from a laptop.,2,11-12-2020 00:01,True,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
kaa713,You dont need bulky gpu. I have rendered 200-300 frames in intel 6000 gpu taking whole day. For this on cycle on ok render quality it will be done in just a couple of minute for the lower end gaming gpus.,3,10-12-2020 11:07,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
kaa713,"Looking at his image, I don't see it being done in a couple of minutes, unless I am making it out to be more awesome than it is. Also lower end gaming gpus are also not feasible to everyone. It was very hard for me to manage money to even buy a laptop with mx150. Anyways my point is don't ridicule him for using eevie. He is doing it for fun, not professionally",3,10-12-2020 11:17,False,neutral,neutral,positive,neutral
kaa713,"This is a low poly model with not much of complex lighting or shaders. It will not take much. 
In my gtx 1050ti i think at the standard render quality. The blenders demo model of car. Which was of high quality. If i remember correctly it took like 5 min or so.",0,10-12-2020 11:23,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral
