l0i1hf,"While I personally prefer to stay grounded centrist in my beliefs, it felt important to have a word with you, specifically evoked with your scoffing attitude towards some handfuls who went off on a tangent to express how unjust the logo is for r/Nepal, a sub meant to flat out represent Nepali art. I'm guessing you're taking pride for having your cultural attire emblemized seeing how strongly you're advocating it; okay, no problem whatsoever but I disgress. Obviously there's nothing wrong with having different beliefs but that ridiculing tone won't be exactly productive for a civil discussion. Just because you pose an impractical solution of squeezing every bit of Nepali cultural identities in a 90X90 pixels size as a means of cultural representation won't do justice. You know this and so does everyone. How about coming up with sth that has been the hallmark of Nepal in everyone's eyes rather than leaning on some cultural aspect that plainly becomes an apple of discord among everyone out there. As much as you'd love to represent your individual distinct culture to the world, there are, as you stated, over 120 ethnic groups claiming their pounds of flesh.
