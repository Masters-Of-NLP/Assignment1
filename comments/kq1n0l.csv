kq1n0l,"Nowadays you need to book a retreat session in order to get into the premises especially if you're a Nepali or a tourist from the subcontinent. I don't blame the officials of the monasteey for this seemingly racist restriction because most visitors that littered around, took the premises for a dating site, caused disturbance to the monastic ambience were unfortuately from Nepal. I wouldn't even hesitate to add that some Nepali visitors  would probably make TikTok videos if granted permission inside. This is a rare occurance with a tourist outside the subcontinent.",2,04-01-2021 16:18,False,negative,negative,negative,negative
