vwhqs6,i never said that but are you saying that this country has to be governed by a man and not a woman? gyanendra is a smart person and he can still manage it till 20 more years until he would decide whom to throne the next king or queen.

You are playing some mental gymnastics to come to this conclusion 

>gyanendra is a smart person and he can still manage it till 20 more years
