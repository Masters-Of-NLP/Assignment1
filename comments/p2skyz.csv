p2skyz,"""India wants to annex Nepal just like Sikkim""? It's a common fear and one that is often exploited for cheap political stunts. Even after the fact that most Sikkimese who voted to join India were Nepalis (which created the whole ethnic cleansings of Lhostampa Nepalis in Bhutan as well).

Not at all helped by some Indian morons who often come here and shout ""Nepal is poor country, it should join India"".

India is a huge country with many neighbors so what happens at Nepal-India border often is not even in local news but incidents at the same border become national headlines here. And those further fuel anti-Indian sentiment.",2,13-08-2021 08:02,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

p2skyz,"All big countries are hated by their neighbors save one or two. Is this any surprise?

China is hated by most of its neighbors. Same goes for Russia. Why would India be in any different position?

Truth to be said, nobody is India's enemy but also, everyone is India's enemy. Same goes for every other great power. The paradox of great powers.

Yeah, ""China did this"" narrative in Indian mainstream media regarding the revised map of Nepal was funny to hear because almost every party from Nepali Congress to every self-proclaimed communist party to even the Madhesi ones voted for it.

For a common indian Nepal is a gud neighbour so we didn't know why would you want to take our land. Before this UN published its world map by cutting our head off(kashmir was marked either disputed or pakistan, i don't remember).

So if u think--first-pak takes kashmir, then china intrudes our boundary and claims it is their land, and last nepal -- publishes its own map. I was like--whats wrong with these people??😂",2,13-08-2021 08:34,False,negative,neutral,negative,negative
