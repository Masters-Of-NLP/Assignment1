io8isy,"Lo-Fi is a genre of music that is slow and repetitive and is a mix of Jazz and Hip-Hop. It also helps people (mostly students) relax and focus on what they are doing. Even,though Lo-Fi is short for low fidelity millions of people from around the world love and cherish Lo-Fi Hip-Hop. As for the Lo-Fi girl she is somewhat of a Lo-Fi icon and she is officially known as ""The Study Girl"". She was made by someone named Machato and the original image used in a video was from a Japanese animated movie ""Whisper of the Heart"" Produced by Studio Ghibli and directed by Yoshifumi Kondo. But, they had to take down the video due to copyright strikes. The Lo-Fi girl is also said to live in France.
I hope that now you know what Lo-Fi Hip-Hop is all about.",7,07-09-2020 16:24,False,positive,positive,positive,positive
