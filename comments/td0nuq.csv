This is borderline harassment. Why don't people mind their own business when they are drunk?

td0nuq," UPDATE:

Hi everyone, just want to update and say that the video has been reported to the tourist police and an investigation is currently underway! I have a meeting with the police officer today to talk about it further, and discuss what kind of actions I want to take. These guys need to be punished for making young girls feel unsafe on the streets of the city they’re in, no matter the time of day or night. And who knows if they’ve done it before to others! Unfortunately this is a very very common occurrence here at night on the streets of Thamel, and I hope these guys get identified and shamed for their actions. Hopefully this will set an example for these kinds of men in the future. 

If you haven’t seen yet, this video is getting lots of popularity on tik tok and other social media platforms. I hope very much that the more it’s seen, the more likely it is we will find these guys and punish them. 

I want to thank everyone for their support of this video - without your help I wouldn’t have known what to do, where to go or how serious this should be taken. I appreciate it. I am a tourist here in your country, and for a moment I felt unsafe, but everyone here has come around me and shown me that I am not alone. Thank you r/Nepal !!!

And It's the street middle in the night. It's not even safe for mens. Like murder/kidnapping and criminal activities is at it's peak. 

While in evening there's active ppl where these behaviors can easily lead to mob Lynching those 2 men. So it has a safe environment not only for female but also for men. 
So no it's not the girls personal responsibility for getting harassed in evenings but at night it's still not their fault but it's their personal responsibility for their own security. 


Kinda like if you left your car unlocked and 3rd person stills your car. Its 3rd person fault that they steal your car but then again it was your personal responsibility too to properly lock the car.....

If you don't want a valid reason for some dude walking then you should have not assumed that girls were out for ""robbery or something"". Its hypocritical. 


Yes I would agree if they wanted more harm they could have done it before she could pick up a camera. Just because they could have done much more garm doesn't give them a free pass to harrass(less harm than a murder as worst case) anybody.
