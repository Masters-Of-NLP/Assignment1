sp8px4,"My father passed away when my mum was still pregnant with me. I had traumas related to this because for a long time I didnâ€™t know about it (I was told that my uncle and aunt were my parents) and later when I found out, I started calculating everything they did and thought it would have been so different if my parents were around. 

Recovered from this a few years ago and still working on trauma bond and trust issues in terms of relationships. At this point, I just use my dark humour to keep him alive within me and has worked pretty well tbh :D

I would suggest to never pressure her to feel grateful that at least she has everything she has wanted despite not having a father. This feeling will grow naturally within her if sheâ€™s raised without the pressure. And ofc, love her endlessly for her to be able to stand up for herself when there are men mistreating her! She will be amazing! <3",3,11-02-2022 05:20,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

sp8px4,"I see. She probably has no memory of him then. 

Maybe your situation is different OP, but I have known a couple of friends who were a bit ashamed or uncomfortable about telling people that they don't have a father. It looks like she is taking it pretty casually right now, and I hope she keeps doing it. And you can help with that by not making it appear like a big deal.  Our society always makes it a big deal, and lots of people are quick to make ""she doesn't have a father"" as the most important thing about her. It's ideal to have a father (of course), but that's definitely not the most important thing about her nor is it something to be hidden or feel ashamed of. It is what it is. Not everyone has all family members (some don't have sister, some don't have brothers, some have no siblings, some have no grandparents etc). Sorry, if this was a bit presumptuous; just wanted to put it out there for anyone reading and have similar situation.",43,10-02-2022 16:32,False,negative,neutral,neutral,neutral

Anyway my intentions here was not to show my self as a superior being to a poor little girl. I was just trying to get some hate and stuff. But now i feel horrible.

sp8px4,"First and foremost OP, you did a great job, stay strong, this will definitely make you stronger and more resilient, all in all, a good human, and I think you already are a beautiful human being (Not talking abt physical aesthetics)

Also, u/ordinaryeeguy is absolutely right. I don't know why our society makes such a big deal out of this. My dad left when I was 15. I was absolutely okie. However, everyone in society was like OMG, it's so sad, awww what is gonna happen or omg now bad things gonna happen to u n ur family or like your future is ruined and I was like huh? wat? why? Not really a social person so I never understood the qualms of society so never affected me much and now when I reflect back on it, everything went as normal as expected. I mean missing dad and the pain of rejection and abandonment is there but that is just the emotional part. Practically life went on as it would have and I am doing well. Stupid People from Society can suck ass. hehe
