klojao,"I used to live in a house like this. I used to get scolded for jumping and playing on the top floor because they could tell by all the dust falling on the lower floors. The wooden stairs used to creak and you could tell if someone was coming up. It's all nostalgia now as it has been replaced by a sunlight-blocking cement Lego building.

So in short, yes I kinda drew your mamaghar, my ghar and all the old ghars that we fondly remember.",6,28-12-2020 17:47,True,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral

klojao,"Are you in Nepal? I looked into some good drawing tablets, but couldn't find a good one for reasonable price here. YouTube says they're no good without pressure sensitivity. I'm a total amateur, so I maybe wrong, but I didn't see any gradual color transition here in this piece. Are you using one without pressure sensitivity?",4,28-12-2020 14:47,False,positive,positive,positive,positive

klojao,"I am in the US. Yes pressure sensitivity and tilt response is needed to make it worthwhile vs pen and paper. Here you can get a basic pen pressure tablet for around $39 to $50 here. If you are starting off, you don't need pressure sensitivity, work on your lines and play with free software like krita. 

Invest in a tablet when you think you will enjoy making stuff.",5,28-12-2020 22:07,True,neutral,positive,positive,positive

klojao,Could you please help out with link/s to the drawing tablet you would recommend for someone who wants to check out digital art? You could DM if it‚Äôs not ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to post a link,1,29-12-2020 09:19,False,positive,neutral,positive,positive
klojao,"I would search on Amazon, brands like XP-PEN, Huion and Wacom. Get the 10 inch ones that have no screen, should run $49-$79. There is a learning curve as you draw by looking at the screen and not where your pen is. If you rather get a screen tablet, get Huion Kamvas 13 which is around $200. 

Finally there is always iPad and Samsung S series tablets. For iPad you need to buy the pen separately and Procreate is a very good app, for Samsung Tab S series you don't need to buy a pen. Even older tablets like Samsung Tab S3 is really good for drawing. Also look at Facebook marketplace or eBay for second-hand ones.

All this is true if you are in the NA or Europe. Try Daraz if you are in Nepal. Hope I helped and good luck.",3,29-12-2020 11:07,True,neutral,positive,neutral,neutral
