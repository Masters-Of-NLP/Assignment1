Probably some of those are fictional, but I definitely remember most as being actually real since I later started using google to confirm my drawings (It got ""lost"" 2 years ago) and I distinctly remember some dinosaurs that I could not believe were actually real. For eg. Pachycephalosaurus; I still can't believe this thing is real cuz of my memories of it shooting laser beams in the cartoon.

Tldr; No, I kinda stopped at \~100 and then it got lost 2 years ago. It had names, coloring and habitat description.",3,08-06-2021 11:42,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
