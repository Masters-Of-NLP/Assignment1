t114jd,"*Section 1.1 Compact Goal. The goal of this Compact is to reduce poverty through economic growth in Nepal (the “Compact Goal”). MCC’s assistance will be provided in a manner that strengthens good governance, economic freedom, and investments in the people of Nepal.*

Cherry picking one word from entire section, taking it out of context.

Section 2.8 (a): No tax on the funding.

Section 2.8 (b): Tax exempt must follow applicable law of Nepal.

Section 2.8 (c): If tax have been paid, GoN will refund it.

We can not just take Section 3.2 (f) on it's own. On it's entirety, Section 3.2 says any innovation and or invention made using this fund MCC can use it anywhere in the world with out fees or royalties, it doesn't say anything about all Nepali intellectual properties automatically belongs to the US. Besides, what intellectual properties do we have that other countries want. Name one.

Section 3.8 (a): GoN must submit audit at least once every six months. MCC can request additional audits from local auditors listed (and agreed upon previously) or US based auditors  selected in accordance of MCC's guideline.

Section 3.8 (b): If an US based non-profit/ for-profit organization is involved US government will use US agencies to do audit on those organizations.

Section 3.8 (c): Based on audits mentioned above, GoN has to take corrective action.

Section 3.8 (d): MCC has right to ask for audit on use of MCC funds.

Section 3.8 (e): MCC fund may be used to fund the audits.

Section 6.1: The US government or anyone related to MCC (not each and every American in the world) can not be sued in ***Nepal*** for any death or injuries caused during, because they will not be the ones constructing the project. Having said that, they are not extended the same immunity if it doesn't involve MCC related activates eg, they can not ask for immunity if they go around shooting people in the street. However, the immunity doesn't extend to any contractors, sub-contractors etc. involved in construction of the projects even if they are Americans.

Section 7.1: *AFTER* the agreement goes into force, in case of conflict, the terms in the compact supersedes those of Nepali law at that point. (However, this is only after the compact have been signed.)

Section 7.2: *BEFORE* the agreement is signed, GoN must insure that the terms in the compact doesn't conflict with current law and constitution of Nepal.

Regarding the annexes he mentioned, Nepal has already chosen two projects, one is the cross border transmission line between Nepal and India (on Nepal's side only), and the other one is to upgrade the East-West National highway. In the agreement, it has stated that we need agreement in place with India for cross border transmission line project. (Without the agreement what will we do? Build a high voltage transmission line and just throw a wire over the border?)

t114jd,"Most of the things he says are not correct. I will try my best to point out the things. I am not a lawyer and this is my understanding of the MCC Compact. And yes some of the wording should be changed.

`Article 1.1:`

`This does not mean MCC (or US) is making investment in Nepal. The line reads as the funds from MCC should be used to increase / strengthen governance economic freedom and investments IN the people of Nepal. This is to increase what the government of Nepal is already putting in for the betterment of country and not some direct investment by the US.`

&#x200B;

Article 2.8: Tax implications (this one is too long to post here)

This article states that the MCC Funding will be tax free and all taxes like VAT, sales tax, excise duty, property transfer etc are not applicable. This is similar to the tax exemption that are given to private entities so that they will start operations in a certain locality which increases the employment, cash flow and over all quality of life of residents. This is done by states of many developed countries who want private business to start operations in the state for development of the state. Nepal has never done this to help develop any private company so this is something new for us and looks wrong.

&#x200B;

`Article 3.2(f): The Government grants to MCC a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide,fully paid, assignable right and license to practice or have practiced on its behalf (including theright to produce, reproduce, publish, repurpose, use, store, modify, or make available) anyportion or portions of Intellectual Property as MCC sees fit in any medium, now known orhereafter developed, for any purpose whatsoever.`

&#x200B;

This does not say that Government of Nepal will not own the Intellectual Property rights of the tools or techniques developed by using MCC Funding as the video suggests. It says Government of Nepal will provide royalty-free license to MCC to be used as MCC sees fit. It will not prevent Nepal from licensing the tools and techniques of the intellectual property to other nations or organizations for some royalty.

&#x200B;

`Article 3.8: Audits, Reviews (posting only a snippet): theGovernment will, on at least a semi-annual basis, conduct, or cause to be conducted, financialaudits of all disbursements of MCC Funding`

&#x200B;

This clearly mentions Government will conduct or cause to conduct audits of MCC Funding on semi annual basis. The point however mentions that the auditor will have to be recognized by Inspector General or a United States based certified public accounting firm. This is to insure that the auditors are not involved in misuse of funding. No where does it say that only United States can do the audit.

&#x200B;

Article 5 (sub section 2,  3, 4 and 5): Again too long to post here.  It says either Government of Nepal or MCC can terminate the Compact with a 30 day notice to the other party without any penalty. As for the refund as mentioned in the video. Government will have to refund the MCC Funding along with interest if and only if the funds have been found out to be misused. This means if any form of corruption or bribery regarding the fund is found out then and only then will Nepal be liable to pay back the funds, profit and interest on them.

&#x200B;

Article 6.8: This states that MCC or the US is not liable for any loss, injuries, death etc that happen under the MCC Funding usage. Even when you are admitted to a hospital you have to sign a form that says something to the effect of ""the hospital is not liable of any injuries / death / mishap caused during the treatment of the patient"". By his logic we should go against the hospital as well.

&#x200B;

Article 7.1: Agreed with him on this point. This should be changed and MCC should not be above the domestic law. But also keep in mind that domestic law of the Government of Nepal are not applicable within the boundaries of the embassies of other country in Nepali Soil.

Annex 1 and 5. The guy from the video has issues with mention of Government of India in these two places. Government of India is mentioned as there are plans to build transmission line from Butwal (Nepal) to Gorakhpur (India). Since the construction of the lines are going to touch the Indian territory it is my belief that the Government of India should also provide approval for the project.

In short, MCC is not a compact that reads like an agreement between equal partners. It's an agreement between a rich donor and an alcoholic father. The rich donor is saying, ""Okay, I will give you money to put your kids in school, but I will need accounting for every penny you spend, and you have to spend everything on things related to the kid's education and things I approve of. And of course, if I find out you have spent any money in other frivolous shits, I will make sure to get that money back; with interest."" Sure, it's not an agreement that makes you feel good when you read it. It clearly mentions who the boss is. But, as an education-deprived kid of a poor alcoholic father, it is still in your best interest to swallow the pride and take the money.",12,25-02-2022 16:35,False,neutral,negative,positive,neutral
t114jd,"उनले भनेका अधिकांश कुरा सही छैनन् । म चीजहरू औंल्याउन सक्दो प्रयास गर्नेछु। म वकिल होइन र यो MCC कम्प्याक्टको मेरो बुझाइ हो। र हो, केहि शब्दहरू परिवर्तन गर्नुपर्छ।

धारा १.१:

यसको मतलब MCC (वा US) ले नेपालमा लगानी गरिरहेको होइन। MCC बाट प्राप्त रकम सुशासनको आर्थिक स्वतन्त्रता र नेपाली जनतामा लगानी बढाउन / सुदृढ गर्न प्रयोग गरिनुपर्छ भन्ने लाइनमा लेखिएको छ। यो नेपाल सरकारले देशको उन्नतिको लागि पहिले नै राखेको कुरालाई बढाउनको लागि हो, अमेरिकाको प्रत्यक्ष लगानी होइन।

लेख 2.8: कर प्रभावहरू (यो यहाँ पोस्ट गर्न धेरै लामो छ)

यस लेखमा एमसीसी कोष करमुक्त हुनेछ र भ्याट, बिक्री कर, अन्तःशुल्क, सम्पत्ति हस्तान्तरण आदि जस्ता सबै करहरू लागू हुने छैनन् भनी उल्लेख गरिएको छ। यो कर छुट जस्तै हो जुन निजी संस्थाहरूलाई दिइन्छ ताकि तिनीहरूले एक निश्चित स्थानमा सञ्चालन सुरु गर्नेछन् जसले रोजगारी, नगद प्रवाह र बासिन्दाहरूको जीवनको गुणस्तरमा वृद्धि गर्दछ। यो धेरै विकसित देशहरूका राज्यहरू द्वारा गरिन्छ जो राज्यको विकासको लागि निजी व्यवसायहरू राज्यमा सञ्चालन गर्न चाहन्छन्। नेपालले कुनै पनि निजी कम्पनीलाई विकास गर्न मद्दत गर्न कहिल्यै गरेको छैन त्यसैले यो हाम्रो लागि नयाँ कुरा हो र गलत देखिन्छ।

धारा ३.२(f): सरकारले MCC लाई दिगो, अपरिवर्तनीय, रोयल्टी-रहित, विश्वव्यापी, पूर्ण भुक्तान गरिएको, तोकिएको अधिकार र अभ्यास गर्न वा अभ्यास गर्ने इजाजतपत्र प्रदान गर्दछ (उत्पादन, पुन: उत्पादन, प्रकाशन, पुन: प्रयोग, प्रयोग गर्ने अधिकार सहित। , भण्डारण, परिमार्जन, वा उपलब्ध गराउने) बौद्धिक सम्पदाको कुनै पनि अंश वा अंशहरू MCC ले कुनै पनि माध्यममा उपयुक्त देखेको छ, जुन अहिले ज्ञात वा पछि विकसित, जुनसुकै उद्देश्यका लागि।

यसले MCC कोष प्रयोग गरेर विकास गरिएका औजार वा प्रविधिहरूको बौद्धिक सम्पदा अधिकार नेपाल सरकारसँग हुनेछैन भनी भिडियोले सुझाव दिएअनुसार होइन। एमसीसी उपयुक्त देखिएमा एमसीसीलाई प्रयोग गर्न नेपाल सरकारले रोयल्टी रहित लाइसेन्स उपलब्ध गराउने उल्लेख छ । यसले नेपाललाई बौद्धिक सम्पदाका औजार र प्रविधिहरू अन्य राष्ट्र वा संस्थाहरूलाई केही रोयल्टीका लागि इजाजतपत्र दिनबाट रोक्ने छैन।

धारा ३.८: लेखापरीक्षण, समीक्षा (एक झलक मात्र पोस्ट गर्दै): सरकारले कम्तिमा अर्धवार्षिक आधारमा MCC कोषको सबै वितरणको वित्तीय लेखापरीक्षण गर्ने वा गराउनेछ।

यसमा सरकारले एमसीसी कोषको अर्धवार्षिक आधारमा लेखापरीक्षण गर्ने वा गराउने स्पष्ट उल्लेख छ। तर बिन्दुले लेखा परीक्षकलाई महानिरीक्षक वा संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका स्थित प्रमाणित सार्वजनिक लेखा फर्म द्वारा मान्यता दिनुपर्ने उल्लेख छ। यो सुनिश्चित गर्न को लागी हो कि लेखा परीक्षकहरु कोष को दुरुपयोग मा संलग्न छैन। अमेरिकाले मात्र लेखापरीक्षण गर्न सक्छ भनी कतै छैन।

लेख ५ (उपखण्ड २, ३, ४ र ५): फेरि यहाँ पोस्ट गर्न धेरै लामो छ। यसमा नेपाल सरकार वा एमसीसीले कुनै जरिवाना बिना अर्को पक्षलाई ३० दिनको सूचना दिएर सम्झौता खारेज गर्न सक्ने बताउँछ। भिडियोमा उल्लेख गरिए अनुसार फिर्ताको लागि। एमसीसी कोषको दुरुपयोग भएको पाइएमा मात्र सरकारले ब्याजसहित फिर्ता गर्नुपर्नेछ । यसको अर्थ कोषमा कुनै किसिमको भ्रष्टाचार वा घूसखोरी भएको पाइएमा त्यसको रकम, नाफा र ब्याज फिर्ता गर्न नेपाल जिम्मेवार हुनेछ ।

धारा 6.8: यसले MCC कोष प्रयोग अन्तर्गत हुने कुनै पनि हानि, चोटपटक, मृत्यु इत्यादिको लागि MCC वा US उत्तरदायी छैन भनी बताउँछ। तपाई अस्पतालमा भर्ना हुँदा पनि तपाईले ""बिरामीको उपचारको क्रममा कुनै चोटपटक/मृत्यु/दुर्घटनाको लागि अस्पताल जिम्मेवार छैन"" भन्ने प्रभावमा केही लेखिएको फारममा हस्ताक्षर गर्नुपर्छ। उनको तर्कले अस्पतालको विरुद्धमा पनि जानुपर्छ ।

धारा ७.१: यस कुरामा उहाँसँग सहमत। यसलाई परिवर्तन गर्नुपर्छ र MCC घरेलु कानुनभन्दा माथि हुनुहुँदैन। तर नेपाली भूमिमा रहेका अन्य देशका दूतावासको सिमानाभित्र नेपाल सरकारको घरेलु कानून लागू नहुने कुरा पनि ख्याल गर्नुहोस्।

एनेक्स 1 र 5। भिडियोको केटाले यी दुई ठाउँमा भारत सरकारको उल्लेख गरेको समस्या छ। बुटवल (नेपाल) देखि गोरखपुर (भारत) सम्म प्रसारण लाइन निर्माण गर्ने योजना रहेको भारत सरकारको उल्लेख छ । लाइन निर्माणले भारतीय भूभाग छुने भएकाले आयोजनाका लागि भारत सरकारले पनि स्वीकृति दिनुपर्छ भन्ने मेरो मान्यता छ ।

 Also, anti-MCC folks mention the intellectual property clause. Let's say I invent a state-of-the-art way to fix the kitchen floor when fixing your kitchen, cannot I claim intellectual property rights over it? Why should I give you the IP rights of that invention? (Section 3.2)

Also, the liability clause is also pretty standard I would say. (Section 6.1)

Maybe there is a hidden agenda that the US has but I do not think US can enforce any of those ambiguous clauses to harm Nepal easily and get away with it.  They will surely have some influence in Nepali politics but I guess the tradeoff of good road and electricity infrastructure over the rare chance that the US will enforce those ambiguous clauses to do something adversarial to Nepal is worth it IMO.
