Also, diplomatic approach doesn‚Äôt work because Putin wants Ukraine while Ukraine wants to remain independent. There is no talking to be had here unless Putin agrees to withdraw.

Russian soldiers are attacking and killing civilians. That‚Äôs a fact. The common people are fighting back, that‚Äôs also a fact.
