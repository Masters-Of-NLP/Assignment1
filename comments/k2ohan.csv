k2ohan,"I don’t regret leaving. It was the best decision I ever made. I heard the ‘Naya Nepal’ bullshit all my life and once I grew older I realized that it’s an unachievable dream. With corruption and nepotism normalized to the extent it is, the country has no chance to get things straight for the common Nepalese. 

The way I see it, I didn’t ask to be born in Nepal. But I had the means to leave Nepal and that I did. I have one life to live and I will live it the way I want, where I want.",47,28-11-2020 16:03,False,negative,negative,negative,negative
