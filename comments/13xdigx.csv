13xdigx,"10 days ago, I lost one of my close neighbors to the Everest.  He was a father to a 5 year old daughter, and a husband to a young (29) wife. As I'm writing this, they are performing the death ritual. This ritual is not easily affordable and last for 7-21 days. 

I feel sad for his family, especially for his daughter who just lost a father figure from her life. And the saddest part is she has no idea about her dad's demise. 

Yeah, it feels great to see people appreciating their work but it's just too dangerous. I don't want other Sherpa die on the mountains but the sad reality is you either climb mountain or go abroad for good money here. 

I've witnessed 3 Sherpas (age range 18-35) being burned, since they didn't make it out from the mountain. We're losing ourselves every year. 

I'm from the Sherpa community, and I've never seen any Sherpa advertising/bragging people that one of the major reasons why world knows Nepal is because of them Sherpas. (Like people do with Buddha and gurkhas). But it breaks my heart when those who died on mountains don't get enough recognition, support and social security.

All they get is insurance money and few donations in their family name. And it seems as if we are trading our lives for few lakhs. We are just another means to make their over ambitious dream come true. :( Hope it gets better in the future.
