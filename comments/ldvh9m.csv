ldvh9m,"Namaste! 

Heed my suggestion, it will make the dish better.

Boil some potatoes, peel them and mash them. Grind them on a mortar with pestle or a flat stone(you must have probably seen one here). It's consistency must be like glue, all sticky. Now, roll some balls from it and let them dry in the sun. After a few days you'll be rewarded with 'Aalu ko Mashyaura'(dried smashed potato balls).

Add them to the soup, it gives an extra element to the soup and it does compliment the soup more.

Enjoy.

What a bunch of npc's... You can swap anyone with anyone and even their parents won't notice any ideological change in their child. 
Their morality too is all foreign-born... They support these causes of lgbtqi and anti racism and sexual freedom not because they feel that way but because some white person through some media (mostly movies and tv shows) told them to care about it. Every sentence that they make are self hating jokes and smelling each other farts saying how woke they are for hating anyone with any political beliefs or in that matter having any belief at all... Only if they knew how spiritual their own home-grown religion is... But all they can talk about is sati and caste system rather than mending the old road they shit on it and go to a foreign road which tbh doesn't want them walking around there",1,06-02-2021 13:57,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

ldvh9m,"It's simply fermented greens/ leaves. The flavor and process is a bit different for every type. The overall process is 

Take leaf greens thoroughly wash it.

Wilt it in the sun or oven take care not to heat it too much. Just enough for it to wilt not dry.if it dries even a little you might not get good results with that whole batch. So better put it out in the sun than oven. If using an oven use lowest heat possible and check regularly.

Use a mortar and pestle or similar equipment to kinda injure the leaves. Take care not to use much force. The purpose it to break/loosen the leaf veins not make a paste or to break the steam off.(this varies with the greens) mustard greens require less of these as the stems arent that tough. But those with tough stems like  turnip or radish greens(traditionally used green) require a bit more.

Then you need to pack it in a vessel traditionally a vessel with open mouth is used. However in my view plastic jars with lids are easier as well as less messy. 

You need to pack it as much as you can with as much force as you can. Take care not to purverize it though and cap off the lid and set it on a window sill or a sunny place to ferment.  It's mostly anaerobic fermentation so try to fill up the vessel. lesser the air gap the better. 

Traditionally pressure is applied and the vessel inverted throughout the process to sequeze out the water as fermented and not let air in. But while using plastic jars you can drain the water by inverting the jar and letting the water out. The water is also used as a form of probiotic and let's you fine tune the flavor of the gundruk. 

Take it out when you feel like it's ready. According to your taste. I guess don't go beyond a fortnight. It is usually ready 9 to 10 days.",13,06-02-2021 15:54,False,neutral,,neutral,neutral
