pzmdw0,"I did this trip back in 2016 July/August but dont do this trip during this time. It was kind of bad decision as almost every day it rained one of my camera lens was ruined(caught fungus due to moisture). 

The best Time to go here is April/may or september to November. It's a long journey. we took a bus from Kathmandu to Gamgadhi. it's a 24 hour ride,the bus stops at Kalikot and you spend the night in hotel. We only travelled to Sinja in Bus and from there we decided to walk upto Rara Lake. You can go to Gamgadhi and walk to Rara lake too (takes couple of hours). From sinja we walked 3 days to reach Sinja. Bear in mind back in 2016 there were no hotels and we were camping. There is hotel in Rara lake though. we stayed 2 days in rara lake and from there we split in two groups one group went towards danfe lake and came to Jumla and another group went through Sinja valley again and met in Jumla. From Jumla we took the bus to Kathmandu( Flight option is there as well).",1,02-10-2021 17:00,True,negative,,negative,negative
pzmdw0,Blue eyes is caused by less melanin( That's what i have heard and read) i have seen few Nepalese with blue eyes. Some of the Khas people in midwest/Farwest region seem to have blue eyes.,1,02-10-2021 21:02,True,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral
pzmdw0,"It wasn't any organized tour. I was with few friends, we just made plan to go to this region for adventure.All of us had extensive travel experience, this is a remote region and there arent many accommodation available so you have to camp. But its been 6 years since i travelled and Rara is famous among travelers these days so i am assuming with the tourists the hotels must have sprouted in the region. Also you dont actually  have to trek, vehicles run through these areas(roads are scary though). I recommend you to travel to this region. The rawness is still there, you will enjoy it.

ANd those chillums are known as Sulpa. Mostly flavored tobacco but i guess people do smoke Hash as well as this region is well known to produce that too.",1,02-10-2021 21:09,True,neutral,neutral,positive,neutral
