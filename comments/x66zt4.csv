I think we are fucked by geography because I literally don't see any way out of this. Nepal doesn't have any gas or petroleum. It has no industries and now even food is being imported from India.

x66zt4,"Everyone else I know that grew up during this time, were irrevocably changed towards at least distrust towards India.

But the worst thing was, hearing from my own parents and elders, that this was not even first time they did so.

In 1989, India blockaded us for opening to closer ties with China, as every other nation was doing at the same time.

In 2015, the blockade was a display of open contempt, for which India holds towards Nepal. 

Indians familiar with the discourse around revocation of Article 370, will openly say a nation Constitution, is its own internal affair. But never extend the same rhetoric to others.

However, despite all of this I still believe in closer integration, with our neighbour down south. But from a position of equals, rather than ruler and subject.

This comes in the form of developing production self-sufficiency and Nepali control over the waters flowing south towards India.

When this is done, the deep economic ties will lead to blockades that will be economically unviable. Whilst bringing prosperity and wealth to both countries, as well as the wider South Asian region.

But I believe this moment is now part of the new national myth, that emerged after the civil war. The idea that the new Republic, was faced with outside threats from its inception, should be the new rallying cry.

And lead to an ever continuing process of self-strengthening, as Japan and China underwent, following their own failures at handling foreign Imperialism.",20,05-09-2022 10:52,False,negative,,negative,negative

I am currently in Nepal, just finished Annapurna circuit. The people I meet are amazing and extremely helpful compared to Indians.

But bro, your roads are so bad, even India is not a developed country, but even the remote parts of our country have better roads than what your ""highways"" have.

You will never have a real economy if the road between the two biggest cities  Pokhara and Kathmandu is so bad it can take eight-ten hours in rains sometimes to cover just 200 kms. Bro, I cycle Chennai -Pondicherry (150km) in eight hours. Not to mention the free luxury spa massage you get + people vomiting all over the bus.

First, you should ban your politicians and government officials + families from using flights within Nepal for travelling, make them travel on your roads.

And why does every shop owner fix the price for Indian products, same biscuits in one shop price is 80, other shop price is 85. I get it, that it is imported, but maybe just keep a fixed rate, like it is 2 times Indian MRP or something.

Not flaming, but the people & tourism is really amazing, but you need to focus on infrastructure too.

Neither in Nepal, that's the irony. There are a few lakh people who hold such citizenship. I suspect it's likely due to lacklustre rules in Nepal, they literally give it away like free coupons every once in a while. While even getting a sim card was difficult in India, as a foreign national.

>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34280015

Yeah, and most of the ethnically aligned identity-based groups have been largely quashed. I personally feel identity-based politics and setup based on it should not be allowed, and I don't see we'll see any change in that status quo. 

Another irony that I see is that the State 2 (the more identity-aligned state where a historically a lot migrants from over the border) recently named the state as 'Madhesh' pradhesh - identity based name. Okay, right now the state is run by Madheshi but there have been little to no change in the social structures. My main point point being, since they complained that the non-madhesis were the opressors, there should have been huge sea of change. But it is very dissapointing to see little to no change - the high caste Madhesis are the real oppressors.

On the note of citizenship, the recent propsed changes doesn't make sense at all. How can any country just give away citizenship to a women who just got married to a nepali man? even India has 7 years. This apparently doesn't apply to women with a foreign husband, however.
