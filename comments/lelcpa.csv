lelcpa,"so you're speaking about politic similarities ? It's hard to say because I only saw a glimpse of your country and our cultures are really different. Someone told me that as well, that they were hopping to be like Switzerland in a couple of decades. Honestly I don't see it possible soon. The infrastuctures, the freedom, healtcare,..

lelcpa,besides there's a lot of mountains it's very different. at least where i was. there was not a lot of rocky mountains like the alps (see the pictures) and because the flora and the agriculture is very different I didn't really see similarities,10,07-02-2021 17:20,True,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

lelcpa,There's a lot of mountains in both of our countries so that's probably the main similartity. Trees and agriculture are very different though so that's the only thing that felt different,8,07-02-2021 14:54,True,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
