hfejxj,Seriously tho looking back at what we were taught in school 'we were brave' but what I think happened was Britain didnt want a country becuase it would be a pain in the ass with this difficult terrain and they could easily control it through Ranas so why bother.

hfejxj,"Well, actually british always wanted to colonize nepal to provide passage for trade route to Tibet. British never favored indian climate, nepal was similar to Britain in terms of climate. Himalayas was dream destination for them. At first they went for diplomatic approach to colonize nepal but egoistic gorkhalis were too reluctant. So anglo-nepal war was fought and nepal lost two thirds of it's land.

This is true. Prithivi narayan shah wanted nuwakot just like his father did. So, he went banaras to change his gotra and buy some weapons and bring muslims to train and make guns. Prithivi narayan shah even stole some of weapons and fled from there using naga sadhus. During his time in banaras he learned that people from India plain looked down upon pahadi people. He met king of doti there. He said that,""we might be gorkhali and doteli in the hills but for this people of plain we are all just pahari."" He also learned about British and their deed in India. 

His motivation to conquer wasn't just to unify but it is one of the reason that you can't deny. He removed all Christians pastors from Nepal when he found they were British spy.",11,25-06-2020 12:40,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral
