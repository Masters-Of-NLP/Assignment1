92,Please do NOT mock your teachers or play stupid pranks.,o5lxfo,592,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/o5lxfo/please_do_not_mock_your_teachers_or_play_stupid/,81,"So, this is the event from today. We had a class at 10. The teacher came and taught us like usual. And the thing about the online class is nobody fucking says anything everyone is muted and teacher le j bhanepani, pitch silence. To make it less weird, I would answer to the questions he asked and what not since people acted like dead meat. So after an hour of the class, a friend told me to not say anything and make the teacher feel weird by nobody talking. I denied at first but then after being forced I thought I should agree to my friends way of being ""fun"" and ""enjoying"". So even I shut up. When he asked ""Bujeu ki bujenau kasaile?"", 60 people listening nobody responding, countless times. He asks something, still silence. The class went pretty long at around 3 hours and I thought this dude here is talking for 3 hours straight teaching things to me and here I am doing some shit. So, yes I started responding and some other guys did as well. But, when the class was over he told us how hard the days were for him. He didn't sleep last night because his sister being in ICU and spent the whole night there. For the sake of teaching us, he came back to the room at 9 and he was so tired from talking all those long hours, he told us he was going to sleep. He could have just missed the class but he came to teach us and here we were doing stupid things, making fun of the way he spoke sometimes and shit. I felt so bad afterwards. My heart went very heavy and since I had no one to share, I am on reddit. People might be going through some hard shit, lets just respect and love everybody (even if they are not going through anything). This involved a teacher but similar is the case with everybody else. I hope his sister recovers fast. This COVID is so fucking stupid: took away my close friends dad as well. I hope nobody has to lose their close ones by this stupid disease. My heart feels relatively less heavier now. Thanks for reading. :)",2021-06-22 12:26:23,False,False,Society/‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ú,0.99
