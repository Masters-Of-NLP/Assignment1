require guidance, please throw me a mention. I will assist you at any hour,
day or night. And, before you are mistaken, I do not seek your hand in a
 romantic way; although I am not opposed in the event you are interested in
 me, as many women often are. I am a man of standard, and I do not bow to 
just any female that comes my way, unlike my peers... So rest assured that I
 will not be in the way of your socializing experience here. Consider
 me a Player 2.. a companion, a partner, and perhaps we can enjoy some
 video games together some time. so I would be happy to assist you in games.
 Platonically of course, unless you (like many others) change your mind on
 that. I look forward to our future together (as friends of course.)",neutral,positive,positive,positive
