135,fnztjy,I think the problem with our discussion is that we are thinking of two different pronunciation of dhal. If you know devnagari then I'm thinking dhal as ‡§¢‡§æ‡§≤ and ‡§¶‡§æ‡§Å‡§≤.

138,fnztjy,"Perhaps. 

I'm guessing this is one of those cases where Urdu and Hindi differ in their pronunciation of certain words. They are different languages but so orally similar it's easy to forget that. Though I have certainly also heard Pakistani folk pronounce it with the hard D, which I'm guessing is retained from their pre-partition localizations. Certainly not all Pakistani speak Urdu though it is the national language. Many speak Punjabi and Hindi and pushto etc as well. So even more variations of the word will exist.

Also I would use the word derivative over mispronunciation. These other names are derived from the original name and adopted into new languages. Mispronunciation makes more sense if the speaker was claiming to still speak the same language. Though in that case, if there's enough differences, that's then called a dialect. And it also becomes a valid pronounciation.

So basically, with how languages work, it's only a mispronunciation (as in invalid pronounciation) if not enough people say it lol",perhaps guessing one case urdu hindi differ pronunciation certain word different language orally similar easy forget though certainly also heard pakistani folk pronounce hard guessing retained pre partition localization certainly pakistani speak urdu though national language many speak punjabi hindi pushto etc well even variation word exist also would use word derivative mispronunciation name derived original name adopted new language mispronunciation make sense speaker claiming still speak language though case enough difference called dialect also becomes valid pronounciation basically language work mispronunciation invalid pronounciation enough people say lol,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
139,fnztjy,"Actually, the word dal/daal is sanskrit word. That's why I said it is correct word because all other language in subcontinent retained it from sanskrit. In sanskrit, dhal means shield. Sanskrit was written in brahmi and later in devnagari which is phonetic script. So, they write both differently and we can see the differences clearly. 

Hindi and urdu are both descendants of hindustani which have huge influence from farsi and arabic. Actually it's India's attempt of sanskritization of hindustani that gave rise to hindi. While urdu kept it's farsi and arabic roots more intact. For ex: sukriya in urdu is farsi but dhanyabad in hindi is directly from sanskrit. Also, strict pronunciation rules were for brahmins so they won't pass down wrong sutras and mantras because of our historic oral traditions.

Hi everyone, just want to update and say that the video has been reported to the tourist police and an investigation is currently underway! I have a meeting with the police officer today to talk about it further, and discuss what kind of actions I want to take. These guys need to be punished for making young girls feel unsafe on the streets of the city they‚Äôre in, no matter the time of day or night. And who knows if they‚Äôve done it before to others! Unfortunately this is a very very common occurrence here at night on the streets of Thamel, and I hope these guys get identified and shamed for their actions. Hopefully this will set an example for these kinds of men in the future. 

If you haven‚Äôt seen yet, this video is getting lots of popularity on tik tok and other social media platforms. I hope very much that the more it‚Äôs seen, the more likely it is we will find these guys and punish them.

I feel sad for his family, especially for his daughter who just lost a father figure from her life. And the saddest part is she has no idea about her dad's demise. 

Yeah, it feels great to see people appreciating their work but it's just too dangerous. I don't want other Sherpa die on the mountains but the sad reality is you either climb mountain or go abroad for good money here. 

I've witnessed 3 Sherpas (age range 18-35) being burned, since they didn't make it out from the mountain. We're losing ourselves every year. 

I'm from the Sherpa community, and I've never seen any Sherpa advertising/bragging people that one of the major reasons why world knows Nepal is because of them Sherpas. (Like people do with Buddha and gurkhas). But it breaks my heart when those who died on mountains don't get enough recognition, support and social security.

All they get is insurance money and few donations in their family name. And it seems as if we are trading our lives for few lakhs. We are just another means to make their over ambitious dream come true. :( Hope it gets better in the future.

Ok. Tell me why Upendra Yadav gave a speech in Maithili and not Hindi in Janakpur? Wouldn't Janakpur be a melting pot city in Madhesh where people of different language and dialects like Bajjika, Bhojpuri, or Awadhi would live. But why didn't he choose to speak in Hindi.  
Ill tell a stupid fuck like you. Because he knows the people there are either not going to understand Hindi or people who wouldn't want him to speak Hindi undermining Maithil culture.

The only people who speak Hindi are your godmothers like Sarita Giri who are born in India and who doesn't have a Madhesi support or Indian agents like CK Lal.

Only the few times Madhesi leaders speak Hindi is in Kathmandu because they know the media is going to be there and they are not speaking to people rather to the government and when they don't want to speak in Nepali for reasons you know.

US uses metric where it's needed like science fields and imperial where it's not.

As stupid to me as getting mad when someone speaks in German online instead of English even tho English is lingua franca of the world,

Just in daily use like how we use feet and inches for height of person or even temperature of a person during fever that you said we should move away from. Using SI in these situations bring no advantage, in terms of things like body temperature it brings more disadvantages even.

Boil some potatoes, peel them and mash them. Grind them on a mortar with pestle or a flat stone(you must have probably seen one here). It's consistency must be like glue, all sticky. Now, roll some balls from it and let them dry in the sun. After a few days you'll be rewarded with 'Aalu ko Mashyaura'(dried smashed potato balls).

Add them to the soup, it gives an extra element to the soup and it does compliment the soup more.

Enjoy.

Take leaf greens thoroughly wash it.

Wilt it in the sun or oven take care not to heat it too much. Just enough for it to wilt not dry.if it dries even a little you might not get good results with that whole batch. So better put it out in the sun than oven. If using an oven use lowest heat possible and check regularly.

Use a mortar and pestle or similar equipment to kinda injure the leaves. Take care not to use much force. The purpose it to break/loosen the leaf veins not make a paste or to break the steam off.(this varies with the greens) mustard greens require less of these as the stems arent that tough. But those with tough stems like  turnip or radish greens(traditionally used green) require a bit more.

Then you need to pack it in a vessel traditionally a vessel with open mouth is used. However in my view plastic jars with lids are easier as well as less messy. 

You need to pack it as much as you can with as much force as you can. Take care not to purverize it though and cap off the lid and set it on a window sill or a sunny place to ferment.  It's mostly anaerobic fermentation so try to fill up the vessel. lesser the air gap the better. 

Traditionally pressure is applied and the vessel inverted throughout the process to sequeze out the water as fermented and not let air in. But while using plastic jars you can drain the water by inverting the jar and letting the water out. The water is also used as a form of probiotic and let's you fine tune the flavor of the gundruk. 

Take it out when you feel like it's ready. According to your taste. I guess don't go beyond a fortnight.

Cherry picking one word from entire section, taking it out of context.

Section 2.8 (a): No tax on the funding.

Section 2.8 (b): Tax exempt must follow applicable law of Nepal.

Section 2.8 (c): If tax have been paid, GoN will refund it.

We can not just take Section 3.2 (f) on it's own. On it's entirety, Section 3.2 says any innovation and or invention made using this fund MCC can use it anywhere in the world with out fees or royalties, it doesn't say anything about all Nepali intellectual properties automatically belongs to the US. Besides, what intellectual properties do we have that other countries want. Name one.

Section 3.8 (a): GoN must submit audit at least once every six months. MCC can request additional audits from local auditors listed (and agreed upon previously) or US based auditors  selected in accordance of MCC's guideline.

Section 3.8 (b): If an US based non-profit/ for-profit organization is involved US government will use US agencies to do audit on those organizations.

Section 3.8 (c): Based on audits mentioned above, GoN has to take corrective action.

Section 3.8 (d): MCC has right to ask for audit on use of MCC funds.

Section 3.8 (e): MCC fund may be used to fund the audits.

Section 6.1: The US government or anyone related to MCC (not each and every American in the world) can not be sued in ***Nepal*** for any death or injuries caused during, because they will not be the ones constructing the project. Having said that, they are not extended the same immunity if it doesn't involve MCC related activates eg, they can not ask for immunity if they go around shooting people in the street. However, the immunity doesn't extend to any contractors, sub-contractors etc. involved in construction of the projects even if they are Americans.

Section 7.1: *AFTER* the agreement goes into force, in case of conflict, the terms in the compact supersedes those of Nepali law at that point. (However, this is only after the compact have been signed.)

Section 7.2: *BEFORE* the agreement is signed, GoN must insure that the terms in the compact doesn't conflict with current law and constitution of Nepal.

Regarding the annexes he mentioned, Nepal has already chosen two projects, one is the cross border transmission line between Nepal and India (on Nepal's side only), and the other one is to upgrade the East-West National highway. In the agreement, it has stated that we need agreement in place with India for cross border transmission line project. (Without the agreement what will we do? Build a high voltage transmission line and just throw a wire over the border?)

4117,t114jd,"Most of the things he says are not correct. I will try my best to point out the things. I am not a lawyer and this is my understanding of the MCC Compact. And yes some of the wording should be changed.

`Article 1.1:`

`This does not mean MCC (or US) is making investment in Nepal. The line reads as the funds from MCC should be used to increase / strengthen governance economic freedom and investments IN the people of Nepal. This is to increase what the government of Nepal is already putting in for the betterment of country and not some direct investment by the US.`

&#x200B;

Article 2.8: Tax implications (this one is too long to post here)

This article states that the MCC Funding will be tax free and all taxes like VAT, sales tax, excise duty, property transfer etc are not applicable. This is similar to the tax exemption that are given to private entities so that they will start operations in a certain locality which increases the employment, cash flow and over all quality of life of residents. This is done by states of many developed countries who want private business to start operations in the state for development of the state. Nepal has never done this to help develop any private company so this is something new for us and looks wrong.

&#x200B;

`Article 3.2(f): The Government grants to MCC a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide,fully paid, assignable right and license to practice or have practiced on its behalf (including theright to produce, reproduce, publish, repurpose, use, store, modify, or make available) anyportion or portions of Intellectual Property as MCC sees fit in any medium, now known orhereafter developed, for any purpose whatsoever.`

&#x200B;

This does not say that Government of Nepal will not own the Intellectual Property rights of the tools or techniques developed by using MCC Funding as the video suggests. It says Government of Nepal will provide royalty-free license to MCC to be used as MCC sees fit. It will not prevent Nepal from licensing the tools and techniques of the intellectual property to other nations or organizations for some royalty.

&#x200B;

`Article 3.8: Audits, Reviews (posting only a snippet): theGovernment will, on at least a semi-annual basis, conduct, or cause to be conducted, financialaudits of all disbursements of MCC Funding`

&#x200B;

This clearly mentions Government will conduct or cause to conduct audits of MCC Funding on semi annual basis. The point however mentions that the auditor will have to be recognized by Inspector General or a United States based certified public accounting firm. This is to insure that the auditors are not involved in misuse of funding. No where does it say that only United States can do the audit.

&#x200B;

Article 5 (sub section 2,  3, 4 and 5): Again too long to post here.  It says either Government of Nepal or MCC can terminate the Compact with a 30 day notice to the other party without any penalty. As for the refund as mentioned in the video. Government will have to refund the MCC Funding along with interest if and only if the funds have been found out to be misused. This means if any form of corruption or bribery regarding the fund is found out then and only then will Nepal be liable to pay back the funds, profit and interest on them.

&#x200B;

Article 6.8: This states that MCC or the US is not liable for any loss, injuries, death etc that happen under the MCC Funding usage. Even when you are admitted to a hospital you have to sign a form that says something to the effect of ""the hospital is not liable of any injuries / death / mishap caused during the treatment of the patient"". By his logic we should go against the hospital as well.

&#x200B;

Article 7.1: Agreed with him on this point. This should be changed and MCC should not be above the domestic law. But also keep in mind that domestic law of the Government of Nepal are not applicable within the boundaries of the embassies of other country in Nepali Soil.

Annex 1 and 5. The guy from the video has issues with mention of Government of India in these two places. Government of India is mentioned as there are plans to build transmission line from Butwal (Nepal) to Gorakhpur (India). Since the construction of the lines are going to touch the Indian territory it is my belief that the Government of India should also provide approval for the project.

In short, MCC is not a compact that reads like an agreement between equal partners. It's an agreement between a rich donor and an alcoholic father. The rich donor is saying, ""Okay, I will give you money to put your kids in school, but I will need accounting for every penny you spend, and you have to spend everything on things related to the kid's education and things I approve of. And of course, if I find out you have spent any money in other frivolous shits, I will make sure to get that money back; with interest."" Sure, it's not an agreement that makes you feel good when you read it. It clearly mentions who the boss is. But, as an education-deprived kid of a poor alcoholic father, it is still in your best interest to swallow the pride and take the money.",general theme reply still applies short mcc compact read like agreement equal partner agreement rich donor alcoholic father rich donor saying okay give money put kid school need accounting every penny spend spend everything thing related kid education thing approve course find spent money frivolous shit make sure get money back interest sure agreement make feel good read clearly mention bos education deprived kid poor alcoholic father still best interest swallow pride take money,neutral,negative,positive,neutral

The concept of Nepal and Nepaliness didn't exist at the time. Nepal referred to Kathmandu only. People identified more with their caste, community and territorial identity. The concept of Nepal as a country and being a Nepali citizen was as non existent as it can get on the minds of Nepali people. Delhi, Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Banaras were closer to the hearts and lives of Nepali citizens than Kathmandu. Go ask your elders who lived through the time.

A Madhesi from Janakarpur or Birgunj identified more with Bhojpuri and Maithili speakers of UP and Bihar. Khas in Western Nepal shared the same feeling for Gadhwal, Kumaoni and other Indian Pahadi Khas. Same with Tibeto-Burmese groups. There must be some element that connects a Madhesi with Sherpa, a Tharu from Bardiya to a Limbu in Bhojpur. 

Geopolitically, Asians countries especially China, South East Asia and South Asia were on metamorphosis phase. Countries were forming and devolving every other day. So, it was necessary to install the idea of oneness among the culturally, linguistically divided citizens of this nation.

And this is not unique to Nepal only. This sort of policies and ideas are adopted and implemented by every other country in the world to unite the citizens of the country under a common banner.

Even today, what's the thing that connects the 125 ethnic groups with each other in Nepal? Nothing but the shared idea of Nepaliness put forward by Mahendra. Take the concept out, the country with disintegrate in no time.

I never said you supported it. I said you were conflating the effects of mahendra's nationalistic policies with the effects of globalization. Which is absolutely warranted because how does one come to that conclusion?

>Globalisation in itself is not something harmful but you need to realise that globalization is direct consequence of colonialism and imperialism which endorsed ""white supremacy"" and still continues to do so.

I won't discuss this here. This will run in tangents which is beside the point I was trying to make. One thing tho, globalization was imminent. Colonisation and imperialism were not. Regarding the rest, one needs to respect ones own culture to fight foreign influence.

>Heck, not just the linguistic diversity but dominant language itself is in danger. So, without fighting this global cultural erasure how do you ensure regional cultural diversity? 

I suggest you read the pedagogy of the oppressed. 

Also, what you don't understand is the importance of communities. Small communities when the state is not trying to erase their existence is much more effective at maintaining their language and culture rather than a huge national community. This is why we fail. When people forget their heritage everything is transactional, to a magar or tharu person what is forgetting nepali when they have no idea how their mother tongue is like? That individual would rather learn english and be employed somewhere else. But if a person is more connected to something that is their own and a community that is thriving than it is different.

Just as actual social justice warriors in Murica have provided white nationalists and alt-right with ammo for ""white man in danger"" narrative, the creation of Mongol National Organization and its consequences have been a disaster to Adivasi Janajati issues in Nepal.

I am 1000% sure Kumaonis and Garwhalis now and Thakuri nobles back then hated the Gorkhali monarchy than anyone else. It's not a ""Mongol"" issue. People are bound to hate a monarchy that does not represent them and historically took away their lands and rights, specifically when Prithvi Narayan Shah is the symbol of ""Hindu rashtra"" and ""Asali Hindustan"" for so many Hindu nationalists.

This is similar to asking Siberian Turks like Yakuts and Chechens in Russia why they don't celebrate Cossack heroes or Russian Tsars who expanded Russia. Or asking Native Americans why they want Columbus Day gone. While our example here in Nepal is not to that extreme, it is almost laughable to pretend atrocities did not happen while Gorkha was expanding. Of course, this happened in a time period where everyone else expanded that way so I personally see no point in hating a dead man.

4411,s24jma,"Yes, you may be correct there is a lot of theoretical in this situation since it's hypothetical anyways.

Nepal is too close to the heartland to be marginalized like the northeastern states. A large part of the rift between the northeast states is also how culturally different they are from the whole idea of India/South Asia.

* Nepal is much closer to other Indian states in terms of culture and language. Nepal has a huge population for being in the Himalayas.
* Nepal would be already ""unified"" into today's territory by the time India gained independence.
* I don't think Nepal would be broken up since that would give 3 States the official language of Nepali so I think they would try to unite the Nepali speaking hills.
* Terai is a different story and I think if early on the majority of Madhesi districts are split and given to Bihar and UP then it will be for the better. I think eastern terai past Kosi, Chitwan, Northern Lumbini terai and far western Terai will stay with Nepal as it has higher Pahadi or Pahadi and Tharu population.
* There definitely will be more development in terms of infrastructure and employment, Highways stretch across Himanchal and Uttarkhandi hills and even trains go up to Shimla. Statewide education programs and healthcare will also have a bigger backing of the central government.
* Kathmandu will be the center obviously and will see much growth as being a State capital and the largest urban region in the Himalayas.
* Nepali politics will be the state politics and will join the handful of states who have communist parties, like West Bengal, Kerela, Tripura but I think it will be a lot weaker in Nepal since the Nepali congress will have a stronger support system  while the communist party will be targeted and sidelined.
* Nepali communities will have a greater presence in Metros like Dehli's and Mumbai and there might be some settlers in the Kathmandu urban region of people from throughout India.

4422,s24jma,"I think playing the shiv sena card is a bit extreme. The Shiv Sena runs of xenophobia based around Mumbai, they don't like how Mumbai is non-Maratha dominated and want to dissolve it back as Maratha territory. Which Honestly could have been prevented if it was made its own state or a union territory like Dehli or Chandigarh.

Nepal doesn't have that kind of place, or sentiment unless the Newars of Kathmandu valley disliking other Nepali becomes a strong enough problem that a shiv sena like coalition forms, which even if it happens will not be a strong coalition since it won't even be supported by all the newars.

Ethnic tensions are bound to occur when you have a multi-ethnic/cultural nation but Nepal has been relatively calm in this aspect compared to other regions of the world that are as diverse as Nepal. I also think it is because since Nepali took over as the dominant language and most of Nepal is also united by religion, Hindu/Buddhist and even Kirat and other Shaman religions are extensions of the Dharmic fold.

""It would always be claiming Darjeeling, the whole sikkim, gigantic chunks of Uttarkhand, and some from UP and Bihar.""

* I don't think this would be much of a problem since Sikkim joined India decades after independence and in this timeline, they would just join India via an extension of Nepal.
* Uttarkhand was formed in 2000 out of Uttar Pradesh as the residents of the Hills wanted a separate state as they didn't culturally, linguistically feel represented and neglected by such a large state government. When they created Uttarkhand they added Terai districts with high population density so the new state is almost 50% Hindi/Urdu defeating the whole reasoning of a separate hill state. Uttarkhand is made up of two cultural spheres of Kumaon and Garhwal, both are a sister culture/language/ethnicity of the Khas, who dominate Nepal culturally. So instead of being trapped in a Hindi-speaking state, I believe there wouldn't be much resistance for it to join Nepal. This is not uncommon as the state of Kerela was formed by merging the linguistically similar Malabar region and the neighboring Kingdoms of Travancore. But also if Uttarkhand doesn't want to join Nepal then I don't think there is enough sentiment in Nepal for any extremism about this.

""We would be an anti-Hindi state.""

* This would make sense since we don't speak Hindi natively, Government, Education will all be conducted in Nepali but since Hindi is close to Nepali Hindi speakers will be fine to travel or work. It will be other north Indian states with a non-Hindi denomination, like Gujrat, Punjab, West Bengal, Assam which are not Hindi-speaking states but Hindi friendly, not like Tamil-nadu or Kerela which are ""anti-Hindi"" and understandably so given the context.",think playing shiv sena card bit extreme shiv sena run xenophobia based around mumbai like mumbai non maratha dominated want dissolve back maratha territory honestly could prevented made state union territory like dehli chandigarh nepal kind place sentiment unless newars kathmandu valley disliking nepali becomes strong enough problem shiv sena like coalition form even happens strong coalition since even supported newars ethnic tension bound occur multi ethnic cultural nation nepal relatively calm aspect compared region world diverse nepal also think since nepali took dominant language nepal also united religion hindu buddhist even kirat shaman religion extension dharmic fold would always claiming darjeeling whole sikkim gigantic chunk uttarkhand bihar think would much problem since sikkim joined india decade independence timeline would join india via extension nepal uttarkhand formed 2000 uttar pradesh resident hill wanted separate state culturally linguistically feel represented neglected large state government created uttarkhand added terai district high population density new state almost 50 hindi urdu defeating whole reasoning separate hill state uttarkhand made two cultural sphere kumaon garhwal sister culture language ethnicity khas dominate nepal culturally instead trapped hindi speaking state believe much resistance join nepal uncommon state kerela formed merging linguistically similar malabar region neighboring kingdom travancore also uttarkhand want join nepal think enough sentiment nepal extremism would anti hindi state would make sense since speak hindi natively government education conducted nepali since hindi close nepali hindi speaker fine travel work north indian state non hindi denomination like gujrat punjab west bengal assam hindi speaking state hindi friendly like tamil nadu kerela anti hindi understandably given context,neutral,,negative,neutral

But the worst thing was, hearing from my own parents and elders, that this was not even first time they did so.

In 1989, India blockaded us for opening to closer ties with China, as every other nation was doing at the same time.

In 2015, the blockade was a display of open contempt, for which India holds towards Nepal. 

Indians familiar with the discourse around revocation of Article 370, will openly say a nation Constitution, is its own internal affair. But never extend the same rhetoric to others.

However, despite all of this I still believe in closer integration, with our neighbour down south. But from a position of equals, rather than ruler and subject.

This comes in the form of developing production self-sufficiency and Nepali control over the waters flowing south towards India.

When this is done, the deep economic ties will lead to blockades that will be economically unviable. Whilst bringing prosperity and wealth to both countries, as well as the wider South Asian region.

But I believe this moment is now part of the new national myth, that emerged after the civil war. The idea that the new Republic, was faced with outside threats from its inception, should be the new rallying cry.

And lead to an ever continuing process of self-strengthening, as Japan and China underwent, following their own failures at handling foreign Imperialism.",everyone else know grew time irrevocably changed towards least distrust towards india worst thing hearing parent elder even first time 1989 india blockaded u opening closer tie china every nation time 2015 blockade display open contempt india hold towards nepal indian familiar discourse around revocation article 370 openly say nation constitution internal affair never extend rhetoric others however despite still believe closer integration neighbour south position equal rather ruler subject come form developing production self sufficiency nepali control water flowing south towards india done deep economic tie lead blockade economically unviable whilst bringing prosperity wealth country well wider south asian region believe moment part new national myth emerged civil war idea new republic faced outside threat inception new rallying cry lead ever continuing process self strengthening japan china underwent following failure handling foreign imperialism,negative,,negative,negative

5044,x66zt4,">There is no concept of dual citizenship in India

Neither in Nepal, that's the irony. There are a few lakh people who hold such citizenship. I suspect it's likely due to lacklustre rules in Nepal, they literally give it away like free coupons every once in a while. While even getting a sim card was difficult in India, as a foreign national.

>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34280015

Yeah, and most of the ethnically aligned identity-based groups have been largely quashed. I personally feel identity-based politics and setup based on it should not be allowed, and I don't see we'll see any change in that status quo. 

Another irony that I see is that the State 2 (the more identity-aligned state where a historically a lot migrants from over the border) recently named the state as 'Madhesh' pradhesh - identity based name. Okay, right now the state is run by Madheshi but there have been little to no change in the social structures. My main point point being, since they complained that the non-madhesis were the opressors, there should have been huge sea of change. But it is very dissapointing to see little to no change - the high caste Madhesis are the real oppressors.

On the note of citizenship, the recent propsed changes doesn't make sense at all. How can any country just give away citizenship to a women who just got married to a nepali man? even India has 7 years. This apparently doesn't apply to women with a foreign husband, however.

I was also in prasadi but never felt same as you.


>
Morning shift. 5.55 ma pugena vanye ya 5.56 ma pugyesi whole day detention


Late ma pani pugeko thyee only few times. They do excuse you for being late if it happens rare and cause is rellavent. They just keep record of your late arrival if it repeats often then your nature can be questioned. So you will be punished by returning you home. 


>Sabai book haru layena vanye punishment, detention and guess what, it used to weigh 4 kg, if you carry sabai book and copy.


Bag chai atti hunthyoo. Its heavy af. Sir le book ma herna lagauxa. But we used to take 2 books of 3. And 1 guy missing each book in a peroid. 3 guys in bench so we always had 2 book in each peroid. Teachers were ok with that until we behaved well.

>If someone saw, sidhai suspend. 

And bahira jani was restricted in clz ko dress. I didn't know reason but they weren't allowed to roam here and there in clz dress. 

>Relation ko kurai nagaram

Lol. You were not when you were in +2. You can't complain.

>11 class ma physics ko period, i had asked one question to teacher, although it was funny tara course related, every student laughed and sir resayo. Coordinator aayo, ghar ma call 15 din suspend.

Sad for you. But that kinda stuff occoured but i didn't remember anyone getting suspend like that. (2 of my classmate were suspended for different discipline reason. 1 broke the bench in his full consciousness. Bahana banaye pani everyone knows. And other one i don't know. But both of them are doing good in life and meintions prasadi was helpful for them for life cause they learned lots of things like discipline punctual ) In the Ek chihan book we were made role play. During that in 1 scenario there was hault. And we all the boys did hault together. Well building sook but nobody said a word.

>dherai wide pant launu prne ali ni milne banayesi detention.

They had own tailor and every pant was made by the school's criteria it was fine until you do modifications on own. Everyone wearing similar type of wide pant so no worry cause there was no shaming.

And all of those rules were for class 11. Rules are compratively less srtict for grade 12. Cause 2 guys with same hailength. The one in grade 12 was let go but student from grade 11 was asked to cut hair. There was 1 friend of us who got comparatively longer hair. But he showed there was the cut mark in head it will expose it in short hair. He was asked to cut hair to the optimum point. 

Yeah prasadi is strict than other collages. But plus point of that if you get the enviornment to study. If one of your friend was not into it. It was made sure others were also disturbed by it. Rotton potato was tried to made good but if they couldnt they were ought to be removed ao others wont get rot. 

There were no bullies out there as well.

Yeah it is strict than other clz. But they can make few exceptions if you got valid reason. And you might have different prospective as well. But i never felt that much strictness. And i did break few rules and had small mistakes.",know mention name united kai chimeki college united vanda 10 strict college ani nepal ko rank 1 college lol prasadian mean pidit prasadian also prasadi never felt morning shift 5.55 pugena vanye ya 5.56 pugyesi whole day detention late pani pugeko thyee time excuse late happens rare cause rellavent keep record late arrival repeat often nature questioned punished returning home sabai book haru layena vanye punishment detention guess used weigh 4 kg carry sabai book copy bag chai atti hunthyoo heavy af sir le book herna lagauxa used take 2 book 3. 1 guy missing book peroid 3 guy bench always 2 book peroid teacher ok behaved well someone saw sidhai suspend bahira jani restricted clz ko dress know reason allowed roam clz dress relation ko kurai nagaram lol 2. complain 11 class physic ko period asked one question teacher although funny tara course related every student laughed sir resayo coordinator aayo ghar call 15 din suspend sad kinda stuff occoured remember anyone getting suspend like 2 classmate suspended different discipline reason 1 broke bench full consciousness bahana banaye pani everyone know one know good life meintions prasadi helpful life cause learned lot thing like discipline punctual ek chihan book made role play 1 scenario hault boy hault together well building sook nobody said word dherai wide pant launu prne ali ni milne banayesi detention tailor every pant made school criterion fine modification everyone wearing similar type wide pant worry cause shaming rule class 11. rule compratively le srtict grade 12. cause 2 guy hailength one grade 12 let go student grade 11 asked cut hair 1 friend u got comparatively longer hair showed cut mark head expose short hair asked cut hair optimum point yeah prasadi strict collage plus point get enviornment study one friend made sure others also disturbed rotton potato tried made good couldnt ought removed ao others wont get rot bully well yeah strict clz make exception got valid reason might different prospective well never felt much strictness break rule small mistake,neutral,,negative,neutral

1. In Nepal I did not really have any difficult parts. Except some areas with some tigers where I walked and camped. There were no big mountains on my way while walking across South Nepal and the weather was fine. People were very friendly and very hospitable and helped me a lot! So walking across all South Nepal was like one smooth 80 day sailing.   
In other countries I had some challendes like walking and camping in the snowy mountains of Turkey with -17 degrees Celsius. Walking across some deserts areas in Iran and in Rajasthan, India with the dialy temperature over +40 degrees Celsius but I kept on walking. Sometimes the rainy periods in different countries have been annoying when for many months all my stuff is wet or very humid. Some more higher crime rate areas in 2 different countries I had heavily armed police escorts walking with me and 2 times I was attacked by dogs. Once in Laos I crossed a big mountain jungle alone and on the third day I finished all the food in my backpack so started to eat raw bamboo leaves.   
But the perhaps the greatest challenges are the inner ones - how to overcome inner negative emotions like greed, anger, hatred and pride and to overcome them with compassion, gratitude and peace.  


2. I would difinetly would like to eat right now some vegan momos with a vegan chow mein and a big bowl of homemade dal soup.

Great questions!   


To walk 20,000 kilometers in 22 countries in a total of 4 years and 3 months.   
I had many resting days and resting periods so I managed to keep my health and weight balanced. My weight varied only 6-7 kilograms from minimum to maximum.   
For over 13 years I have been a very strict vegetarian not eating any meat, fish, or eggs. And the last over 4 years a vegan not even eating any milk products.   
I managed to keep it that way 100% even while traveling.   
While on the road I ate a lot of peanuts and fruits. Always had some peanuts in my bag.

Some bandages to cover wounds, some oils and creams to heal bug bites and muscle pains, a needle and a thread to fix stuff, some tape, some small ropes, mosquito spray if they were around.

What else?

Very well packed passport, bank card, ID card, money, the flag of Estonia, a notebook and pencil, mobile, small pocket camera, small mp3 player with a very good battery, earphones, charges for the mobile and camera, later I had a very good solar charger that was on my bag in the daytime.

A very big world map not for navigation but to show my route and the location of my home country, some very small lucky gifts that people gave me, usually a book or even 2, later I had a kindle reader which was a gift for me and also 2 water filters with bottles.

When I started I had a small laptop but later I managed to do everything with mobile and I was given a small external Bluetooth keyboard for faster typing.

A lighter, a knife to cut tomatoes and stuff, sometimes small foldable scissors, a foldable silicone bowl, and a cup, fork, and a spoon.

When I was colder or raining I had a jacket, raincoat, or even thermal clothes and thermal socks. I have gifted a bamboo flute which I carried and learned to play.

Cannot remember more things now.

Thanks a lot for writing! How are you?  
By profession, I am a musician. I studied classical European music, how to play the trumpet, piano, and how to compose music.  


In my long walk of 20,000 kilometers in 22 countries in over 4 years, all my travel expenses for 1 FULL YEAR (foods, drinks, accommodations, some new shoes, clothes, travel and hiking equipment, few new mobile phones and cameras that broke on the way, all the visas and tickets for popular touristic places, and all the other stuff) were average 3,000 - 3,600 euros which are 400,000 - 500,000 Nepali rupees for 1 full year.   


Before I started this long walk I had my own house in Estonia in Northern Europe. I rented out my house and the monthly rent money started to help a bit. But on the starting day, the amount of money that I had in my pocket and my bank account was a total of 8 euros which is less than 1,100 Nepali rupees. I filled up my water bottles in the petrol stations, found some public water pumps, and asked for water from my fellow countrymen like a beggar. Bought some very cheap bread and I was even collecting, washing, and eating many big bags of edible leaves from the roadside.

1. Before I started this long walk I had my own house in Estonia in Northern Europe. I rented out my house and the monthly rent money started to help a bit. But on the starting day, the amount of money that I had in my pocket and my bank account was a total of 8 euros which is less than 1,100 Nepali rupees. I filled up my water bottles in the petrol stations, found some public water pumps, and asked for water from my fellow countrymen like a beggar. Bought some very cheap bread and I was even collecting, washing, and eating many big bags of edible leaves from the roadside. Those were the very first weeks before I received the first rent money. After 1 year of traveling, I sold my house!   
For over 650 nights I slept alone in a tent and I also slept in over 220 local homes together with the local families who invited me to their homes.

2. Before this walking tour, I had already visited Nepal in 2012. That time I was mostly exploring North areas near the Himalayas. Did some trekking but also used cars, buses, etc...  
Totally fell in love with the Nepali people and nature and really wanted to return.  

3. I did not consult any Nepalese while planning my route and travel plans.   
I just searched for some information on the internet.  

4. I was invited to visit some schools, to share some travel experiences, and to answer questions. Never crashed in by myself, only went when invited.   

5. Yes, I will definitely return to Nepal to explore much more!  

6. I don't know exactly how much money I spent in Nepal. But in my long walk of 20,000 kilometers in 22 countries in over 4 years all my travel expenses for 1 FULL YEAR (foods, drinks, accommodations, some new shoes, clothes, travel and hiking equipment, few new mobile phones and cameras that broke on the way, all the visas and tickets for popular touristic places, and all the other stuff) were average 3,000-3,600 euros which are 400,000 - 500,000 Nepali rupees for 1 full year.  

7. In Nepal, the best experiences were inside the local homes. Few people invited me to stay and to sleep in their homes with their families. Those were always very interesting and beautiful experiences. Home is the most private place - a holy place. To be inside and local home together with a local family is surely one of the most special and enriching experiences that can happen to any traveler.   
In Nepal, I did not have any really bad experience. Only once y mobile got stolen but it was largely my own fault. I was invited to visit one small school and left my mobile for charging in one room and left the room. Someone took it. The teachers searched so many places but could not find it. The principal was crying on my knees and told me how sad he is. But his lead to another interesting experience as we went to visit 4 different shamans or witches that did some very interesting rituals to see who took my mobile. Hahaaa...  

8. Walking across  Nepal was a very very beautiful experience. The hospitality of the Nepali people is amazing. So many people invited me to stay in their homes, were very trusting and open. A lot of people helped me on the road by giving me free drinks and food! A huge help!!! I have traveled now in over 40 countries but Nepal and Nepali people are still my absolute nr. 1 favorite and I really dream and plan to return one day!",hello panditume thanks lot writing great question 1. started long walk house estonia northern europe rented house monthly rent money started help bit starting day amount money pocket bank account total 8 euro le 1 100 nepali rupee filled water bottle petrol station found public water pump asked water fellow countryman like beggar bought cheap bread even collecting washing eating many big bag edible leaf roadside first week received first rent money 1 year traveling sold house 650 night slept alone tent also slept 220 local home together local family invited home almost every day helped many local people different village surprised see asked many question inspired long walk offered free drink food new shoe many gift many kind helpful people world especially smaller place tourist normally never go helped 2 200 kind people way many people around world also inspired really wanted send donation also asked write travel news article gave international interview earned bit money travel photo youtube video 2. walking tour already visited nepal 2012. time mostly exploring north area near himalaya trekking also used car bus etc totally fell love nepali people nature really wanted return 3. consult nepalese planning route travel plan searched information internet 4. invited visit school share travel experience answer question never crashed went invited 5. yes definitely return nepal explore much 6. know exactly much money spent nepal long walk 20 000 kilometer 22 country 4 year travel expense 1 full year food drink accommodation new shoe clothes travel hiking equipment new mobile phone camera broke way visa ticket popular touristic place stuff average 3 000 3 600 euro 400 000 500 000 nepali rupee 1 full year 7. nepal best experience inside local home people invited stay sleep home family always interesting beautiful experience home private place holy place inside local home together local family surely one special enriching experience happen traveler nepal really bad experience mobile got stolen largely fault invited visit one small school left mobile charging one room left room someone took teacher searched many place could find principal cry knee told sad lead another interesting experience went visit 4 different shaman witch interesting ritual see took mobile hahaaa 8. walking across nepal beautiful experience hospitality nepali people amazing many people invited stay home trusting open lot people helped road giving free drink food huge help traveled 40 country nepal nepali people still absolute nr 1 favorite really dream plan return one day,positive,,positive,positive

Traveling around the world mostly by walking is for me a very real, true, big, and powerful dream which I really want to do.   


What does irl mean? In real life? Currently, I stay in Vietnam together with my wife and daughter. We are waiting for the global virus situation to get better so that we could continue to travel around the world all 3 of us.   
I write a lot of travel stories, articles, collect real-life stories, record songs and music,  make travel photographs, and sometimes sell them. Also, make travel films and vlogs for my [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/meigomark) channel.
